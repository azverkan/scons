# Right now, due to interaction with external quoting conventions,
# we do NOT actually support arbitrary characters in file names.
# (For example, double-quotes in a file name on POSIX break due
# to interaction with the "sh -c" quoting conventions.)
#
# This is a tough nut to crack, though.  Right now, we use the
# external command interpreters so we don't have to roll our own
# parsing and interpretation of redirection and piping.  But that
# means we have to find ways to work with *all* of their quoting
# conventions.
#
# Until we sort that all out, short-circuit this test so we can
# check it in and avoid having to re-invent this wheel later.
