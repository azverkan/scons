.SH DESCRIPTION

The 
.B sconsign
command
displays the contents of one or more
.B .sconsign

Each entry is printed in the following format:

    file: timestamp bsig csig
            implicit_dependency_1
            implicit_dependency_2

If the entry has no timestamp, bsig, or csig, a dash
(\fR\-\fP) is printed instead.
If the entry has no implicit dependencies,
the lines are simply omitted.
