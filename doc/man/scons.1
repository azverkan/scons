.SH NAME
scons \- a software construction tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B scons
[
.IR options ...
]
[
.IR name = val ...
]
[
.IR targets ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION

The 
.B scons 
utility builds software (or other files) by determining which
component pieces must be rebuilt and executing the necessary commands to
rebuild them.

By default, 
.B scons 
searches for a file named 
.IR SConstruct ,
.IR Sconstruct ,
or
.I sconstruct
(in that order) in the current directory and reads its
configuration from the first file found.
An alternate file name may be
specified via the 
.B -f
option.

The
.I SConstruct
file can specify subsidiary
configuration files using the
.B SConscript()
function.
By convention,
these subsidiary files are named
.IR SConscript ,
although any name may be used.
(Because of this naming convention,
the term "SConscript files"
is sometimes used to refer
generically to all
.B scons
configuration files,
regardless of actual file name.)

The configuration files
specify the target files to be built, and
(optionally) the rules to build those targets.  Reasonable default
rules exist for building common software components (executable
programs, object files, libraries), so that for most software
projects, only the target and input files need be specified.

.B scons
reads and executes the SConscript files as Python scripts,
so you may use normal Python scripting capabilities
(such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported Python libraries)
to handle complicated build situations.
.BR scons ,
however, reads and executes all of the SConscript files
.I before
it begins building any targets.
To make this obvious,
.B scons
prints the following messages about what it is doing:

.ES
$ scons foo.out
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$
.EE

The status messages
(everything except the line that reads "cp foo.in foo.out")
may be suppressed using the
.B -Q
option.

.B scons
does not automatically propagate
the external environment used to execute
.B scons
to the commands used to build target files.
This is so that builds will be guaranteed
repeatable regardless of the environment
variables set at the time
.B scons
is invoked.
This also means that if the compiler or other commands
that you want to use to build your target files
are not in standard system locations,
.B scons
will not find them unless
you explicitly set the PATH
to include those locations.
Whenever you create an
.B scons
construction environment,
you can propagate the value of PATH
from your external environment as follows:

.ES
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})
.EE

Similarly, if the commands use external environment variables
like $PATH, $HOME, $JAVA_HOME, $LANG, $SHELL, $TERM, etc.,
these variables can also be explicitly propagated:

.ES
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH'],
                         'HOME' : os.environ['HOME']})
.EE

Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's
complete external environment:

.ES
import os
env = Environment(ENV = os.environ['PATH'])
.EE

This comes at the expense of making your build
dependent on the user's environment being set correctly,
but it may be more convenient for many configurations.

.B scons
can scan known input files automatically for dependency
information (for example, #include statements
in C or C++ files) and will rebuild dependent files appropriately
whenever any "included" input file changes. 
.B scons
supports the
ability to define new scanners for unknown input file types.

.B scons
knows how to fetch files automatically from
SCCS or RCS subdirectories
using SCCS, RCS or BitKeeper.

.B scons
is normally executed in a top-level directory containing a
.I SConstruct
file, optionally specifying
as command-line arguments
the target file or files to be built.

By default, the command

.ES
scons
.EE

will build all target files in or below the current directory.
Explicit default targets
(to be built when no targets are specified on the command line)
may be defined the SConscript file(s)
using the
.B Default()
function, described below.

Even when
.B Default()
targets are specified in the SConscript file(s),
all target files in or below the current directory
may be built by explicitly specifying
the current directory (.)
as a command-line target:

.ES
scons .
.EE

Building all target files,
including any files outside of the current directory,
may be specified by supplying a command-line target
of the root directory (on POSIX systems):

.ES
scons /
.EE

or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets
should be built (on Windows systems):

.ES
scons C:\\ D:\\
.EE

To build only specific targets,
supply them as command-line arguments:

.ES
scons foo bar
.EE

in which case only the specified targets will be built
(along with any derived files on which they depend).

Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is not
necessary.  The 
.B -c
flag removes all files
necessary to build the specified target:

.ES
scons -c .
.EE

to remove all target files, or:

.ES
scons -c build export
.EE

to remove target files under build and export.
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
Clean() function.

A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by
remaining at the top-level directory (where the 
.I SConstruct
file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to be
built:

.ES
scons src/subdir
.EE

or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
.B -u
option, which traverses up the directory
hierarchy until it finds the 
.I SConstruct
file, and then builds
targets relatively to the current subdirectory:

.ES
cd src/subdir
scons -u .
.EE

.B scons
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
.B -j
option that takes, as its argument, the number
of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:

.ES
scons -j 4
.EE

builds four targets in parallel, for example.

.B scons
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can
be shared between multiple builds.  When caching is enabled in a
SConscript file, any target files built by 
.B scons
will be copied
to the cache.  If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it
will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally.
Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
.BR --cache-force , 
.BR --cache-disable ,
and
.B --cache-show
command-line options.  The
.B --random
option is useful to prevent multiple builds
from trying to update the cache simultaneously.

Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript file(s)
may be specified on the command line:

.ES
scons debug=1 .
.EE

These variables are available in SConscript files
through the ARGUMENTS dictionary,
and can be used in the SConscript file(s) to modify
the build in any way:

.ES
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
else:
    env = Environment()
.EE

The command-line variable arguments are also available
in the ARGLIST list,
indexed by their order on the command line.
This allows you to process them in order rather than by name,
if necessary.
ARGLIST[0] returns a tuple
containing (argname, argvalue).
A Python exception is thrown if you
try to access a list member that
does not exist.

.B scons
requires Python version 1.5.2 or later.
There should be no other dependencies or requirements to run
.B scons.

.\" The following paragraph reflects the default tool search orders
.\" currently in SCons/Tool/__init__.py.  If any of those search orders
.\" change, this documentation should change, too.
By default,
.B scons
knows how to search for available programming tools
on various systems.
On Windows systems,
.B scons
searches in order for the
Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
the MinGW tool chain,
the Intel compiler tools,
and the PharLap ETS compiler.
On OS/2 systems,
.B scons
searches in order for the 
OS/2 compiler,
the GCC tool chain,
and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Sun Solaris systems,
.B scons
searches for the native compiler tools
(MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively)
and the GCC tool chain.
On all other platforms,
including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
.B scons
searches in order
for the GCC tool chain,
the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
and the Intel compiler tools.
You may, of course, override these default values
by appropriate configuration of
Environment construction variables.

.SH OPTIONS
In general, 
.B scons 
supports the same command-line options as GNU
.BR make , 
and many of those supported by 
.BR cons .

.TP
-b
Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of
.BR make.

.TP
-c, --clean, --remove
Clean up by removing all target files for which a construction
command is specified.
Also remove any files or directories associated to the construction command
using the Clean() function.

.TP
--cache-disable, --no-cache
Disable the derived-file caching specified by
.BR CacheDir ().
.B scons
will neither retrieve files from the cache
nor copy files to the cache.

.TP
--cache-force, --cache-populate
When using
.BR CacheDir (),
populate a cache by copying any already-existing, up-to-date
derived files to the cache,
in addition to files built by this invocation.
This is useful to populate a new cache with
all the current derived files,
or to add to the cache any derived files
recently built with caching disabled via the
.B --cache-disable
option.

.TP
--cache-show
When using
.BR CacheDir ()
and retrieving a derived file from the cache,
show the command
that would have been executed to build the file,
instead of the usual report,
"Retrieved `file' from cache."
This will produce consistent output for build logs,
regardless of whether a target
file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache.

.TP
.RI --config= mode
This specifies how the
.B Configure
call should use or generate the
results of configuration tests.
The option should be specified from
among the following choices:

.TP
--config=auto
scons will use its normal dependency mechanisms
to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not.
This saves time by not running the same configuration tests
every time you invoke scons,
but will overlook changes in system header files
or external commands (such as compilers)
if you don't specify those dependecies explicitly.
This is the default behavior.

.TP
--config=force
If this option is specified,
all configuration tests will be re-run
regardless of whether the
cached results are out of date.
This can be used to explicitly
force the configuration tests to be updated
in response to an otherwise unconfigured change
in a system header file or compiler.

.TP
--config=cache
If this option is specified,
no configuration tests will be rerun
and all results will be taken from cache.
Note that scons will still consider it an error
if --config=cache is specified
and a necessary test does not
yet have any results in the cache.

.TP 
.RI "-C" " directory" ",  --directory=" directory
Change to the specified 
.I directory
before searching for the 
.IR SConstruct ,
.IR Sconstruct ,
or
.I sconstruct
file, or doing anything
else.  Multiple 
.B -C
options are interpreted
relative to the previous one, and the right-most
.B -C
option wins. (This option is nearly
equivalent to 
.BR "-f directory/SConstruct" ,
except that it will search for
.IR SConstruct ,
.IR Sconstruct , 
or
.I sconstruct
in the specified directory.)

.\" .TP
.\" -d
.\" Display dependencies while building target files.  Useful for
.\" figuring out why a specific file is being rebuilt, as well as
.\" general debugging of the build process.

.TP
-D
Works exactly the same way as the
.B -u
option except for the way default targets are handled.
When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line,
all default targets are built, whether or not they are below the current
directory.

.TP
.RI --debug= type
Debug the build process.
.I type
specifies what type of debugging:

.TP
--debug=count
Print how many objects are created
of the various classes used internally by SCons
before and after reading the SConscript files
and before and after building targets.
This only works when run under Python 2.1 or later.

.TP
--debug=dtree
Print the dependency tree
after each top-level target is built. This prints out only derived files.

.TP
--debug=explain
Print an explanation of precisely why
.B scons
is deciding to (re-)build any targets.
(Note:  this does not print anything
for targets that are
.I not
rebuilt.)

.TP
--debug=findlibs
Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries
to print a message about each potential library
name it is searching for,
and about the actual libraries it finds.

.TP
--debug=includes
Print the include tree after each top-level target is built. 
This is generally used to find out what files are included by the sources
of a given derived file:

.ES
$ scons --debug=includes foo.o
.EE

.TP
--debug=memoizer
Prints a summary of hits and misses in the Memoizer,
the internal SCons subsystem for caching
various values in memory instead of
recomputing them each time they're needed.

.TP
--debug=memory
Prints how much memory SCons uses
before and after reading the SConscript files
and before and after building targets.

.TP
--debug=nomemoizer
Disables use of the Memoizer,
the internal SCons subsystem for caching
various values in memory instead of
recomputing them each time they're needed.
This provides more accurate counts of the
underlying function calls in the 
Python profiler output when using the
.RI --profile=
option.
(When the Memoizer is used,
the profiler counts all
memoized functions as being executed
by the Memoizer's wrapper calls.)

.TP
--debug=objects
Prints a list of the various objects
of the various classes used internally by SCons.
This only works when run under Python 2.1 or later.

.TP
--debug=pdb
Re-run SCons under the control of the
.RI pdb
Python debugger.

.TP
--debug=presub
Print the raw command line used to build each target
before the construction environment variables are substituted.
Also shows which targets are being built by this command.
Output looks something like this:
.ES
$ scons --debug=presub
Building myprog.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
...
.EE

.TP
--debug=stacktrace
Prints an internal Python stack trace
when encountering an otherwise unexplained error.

.TP
--debug=stree
Print the dependency tree along with status information.  This is the
same as the debug=tree option, but additional status information is
provided for each node in the tree.

.TP
--debug=time
Prints various time profiling information: the time spent
executing each build command, the total build time, the total time spent
executing build commands, the total time spent executing SConstruct and
SConscript files, and the total time spent executing SCons itself.

.TP
--debug=tree
Print the dependency tree
after each top-level target is built. This prints out the complete
dependency tree including implicit dependencies and ignored
dependencies.

.TP
.RI --diskcheck= types
Enable specific checks for
whether or not there is a file on disk
where the SCons configuration expects a directory
(or vice versa),
and whether or not RCS or SCCS sources exist
when searching for source and include files.
The
.I types
argument can be set to:
.BR all ,
to enable all checks explicitly
(the default behavior);
.BR none ,
to disable all such checks;
.BR match ,
to check that files and directories on disk
match SCons' expected configuration;
.BR rcs ,
to check for the existence of an RCS source
for any missing source or include files;
.BR sccs ,
to check for the existence of an SCCS source
for any missing source or include files.
Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas;
for example,
.B --diskcheck=sccs,rcs
would still check for SCCS and RCS sources,
but disable the check for on-disk matches of files and directories.
Disabling some or all of these checks
can provide a performance boost for large configurations,
or when the configuration will check for files and/or directories
across networked or shared file systems,
at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build
or of not handling errors gracefully
(if include files really should be
found in SCCS or RCS, for example,
or if a file really does exist
where the SCons configuration expects a directory).

.\" .TP
.\" -e, --environment-overrides
.\" Variables from the execution environment override construction
.\" variables from the SConscript files.

.TP
.RI -f " file" ", --file=" file ", --makefile=" file ", --sconstruct=" file
Use 
.I file 
as the initial SConscript file.

.TP 
-h, --help
Print a local help message for this build, if one is defined in
the SConscript file(s), plus a line that describes the 
.B -H
option for command-line option help.  If no local help message
is defined, prints the standard help message about command-line
options.  Exits after displaying the appropriate message.

.TP
-H, --help-options
Print the standard help message about command-line options and
exit.

.TP
-i, --ignore-errors
Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.

.TP 
.RI -I " directory" ", --include-dir=" directory
Specifies a 
.I directory
to search for
imported Python modules.  If several 
.B -I
options
are used, the directories are searched in the order specified.

.TP
--implicit-cache
Cache implicit dependencies. This can cause 
.B scons
to miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases where a new implicit
dependency is added earlier in the implicit dependency search path
(e.g. CPPPATH) than a current implicit dependency with the same name.

.TP
--implicit-deps-changed
Force SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This causes the
implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached. This implies
.BR --implicit-cache .

.TP
--implicit-deps-unchanged
Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies.
This causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used.
This implies 
.BR --implicit-cache .

.TP
.RI -j " N" ", --jobs=" N
Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously.
If there is more than one 
.B -j 
option, the last one is effective.
.\" ??? If the 
.\" .B -j 
.\" option
.\" is specified without an argument,
.\" .B scons 
.\" will not limit the number of
.\" simultaneous jobs.

.TP
-k, --keep-going
Continue as much as possible after an error.  The target that
failed and those that depend on it will not be remade, but other
targets specified on the command line will still be processed.

.\" .TP
.\" .RI  -l " N" ", --load-average=" N ", --max-load=" N
.\" No new jobs (commands) will be started if
.\" there are other jobs running and the system load
.\" average is at least 
.\" .I N
.\" (a floating-point number).

.TP
.RI --duplicate= ORDER
There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard links,
soft (symbolic) links and copies. The default behaviour of SCons is to 
prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You can specify different
behaviours with this option.
.IR ORDER 
must be one of 
.IR hard-soft-copy
(the default),
.IR soft-hard-copy ,
.IR hard-copy ,
.IR soft-copy
or
.IR copy .
SCons will attempt to duplicate files using
the mechanisms in the specified order.

.\"
.\" .TP
.\" --list-derived
.\" List derived files (targets, dependencies) that would be built,
.\" but do not build them.
.\" [XXX This can probably go away with the right
.\" combination of other options.  Revisit this issue.]
.\"
.\" .TP
.\" --list-actions
.\" List derived files that would be built, with the actions
.\" (commands) that build them.  Does not build the files.
.\" [XXX This can probably go away with the right
.\" combination of other options.  Revisit this issue.]
.\"
.\" .TP
.\" --list-where
.\" List derived files that would be built, plus where the file is
.\" defined (file name and line number).  Does not build the files.
.\" [XXX This can probably go away with the right
.\" combination of other options.  Revisit this issue.]

.TP
-m
Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of
.BR make .

.TP
.RI --max-drift= SECONDS
Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files to 
.IR SECONDS .
This value determines how long a file must be unmodified
before its cached content signature
will be used instead of
calculating a new content signature (MD5 checksum)
of the file's contents.
The default value is 2 days, which means a file must have a
modification time of at least two days ago in order to have its
cached content signature used.
A negative value means to never cache the content
signature and to ignore the cached value if there already is one. A value
of 0 means to always use the cached signature,
no matter how old the file is.

.TP
-n, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
No execute.  Print the commands that would be executed to build
any out-of-date target files, but do not execute the commands.

.\" .TP
.\" .RI -o " file" ", --old-file=" file ", --assume-old=" file
.\" Do not rebuild

.TP
.RI --profile= file
Run SCons under the Python profiler
and save the results in the specified
.IR file .
The results may be analyzed using the Python
pstats module.

.TP
-q, --question
Do not run any commands, or print anything.  Just return an exit
status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to
date, non-zero otherwise.
.TP
-Q
Quiets SCons status messages about
reading SConscript files,
building targets
and entering directories.
Commands that are executed
to rebuild target files are still printed.

.\" .TP
.\" -r, -R, --no-builtin-rules, --no-builtin-variables
.\" Clear the default construction variables.  Construction
.\" environments that are created will be completely empty.

.TP
--random
Build dependencies in a random order.  This is useful when
building multiple trees simultaneously with caching enabled,
to prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build
or retrieve the same target files.

.TP
-s, --silent, --quiet
Silent.  Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild
target files.
Also suppresses SCons status messages.

.TP
-S, --no-keep-going, --stop
Ignored for compatibility with GNU 
.BR make .

.TP
-t, --touch
Ignored for compatibility with GNU
.BR make .  
(Touching a file to make it
appear up-to-date is unnecessary when using 
.BR scons .)

.TP
.RI --taskmastertrace= file
Prints trace information to the specified
.I file
about how the internal Taskmaster object
evaluates and controls the order in which Nodes are built.
A file name of
.B -
may be used to specify the standard output.

.TP
-u, --up, --search-up
Walks up the directory structure until an 
.I SConstruct ,
.I Sconstruct
or 
.I sconstruct
file is found, and uses that
as the top of the directory tree.
If no targets are specified on the command line,
only targets at or below the
current directory will be built.

.TP
-U
Works exactly the same way as the
.B -u
option except for the way default targets are handled.
When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line,
all default targets that are defined in the SConscript(s) in the current
directory are built, regardless of what directory the resultant targets end
up in.

.TP
-v, --version
Print the 
.B scons
version, copyright information,
list of authors, and any other relevant information.
Then exit.

.TP
-w, --print-directory
Print a message containing the working directory before and
after other processing.

.TP
.RI --warn= type ", --warn=no-" type
Enable or disable warnings.
.I type
specifies the type of warnings to be enabled or disabled:

.TP
--warn=all, --warn=no-all
Enables or disables all warnings.

.TP
--warn=dependency, --warn=no-dependency
Enables or disables warnings about dependencies.
These warnings are disabled by default.

.TP
--warn=deprecated, --warn=no-deprecated
Enables or disables warnings about use of deprecated features.
These warnings are enabled by default.

.TP
--warn=missing-sconscript, --warn=no-missing-sconscript

.SS Construction Environments
A construction environment is the basic means by which the SConscript
files communicate build information to 
.BR scons .
A new construction environment is created using the 
.B Environment 
function:

.ES
env = Environment()
.EE

By default, a new construction environment is
initialized with a set of builder methods
and construction variables that are appropriate
for the current platform.
An optional platform keyword argument may be
used to specify that an environment should
be initialized for a different platform:

.ES
env = Environment(platform = 'cygwin')
env = Environment(platform = 'os2')
env = Environment(platform = 'posix')
env = Environment(platform = 'win32')
.EE

Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
construction variables in the environment
to use and generate file names with prefixes
and suffixes appropriate for the platform.

Note that the
.B win32
platform adds the
.B SYSTEMDRIVE
and
.B SYSTEMROOT
variables from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
.B ENV
dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
(such as fetching source files from
external CVS repository specifications like 
.BR :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/scons )
will work on Windows systems.

The platform argument may be function or callable object,
in which case the Environment() method
will call the specified argument to update
the new construction environment:

.ES
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform = my_platform)
.EE

Additionally, a specific set of tools
with which to initialize the environment
may specified as an optional keyword argument:

.ES
env = Environment(tools = ['msvc', 'lex'])
.EE

Non-built-in tools may be specified using the toolpath argument:

.ES
env = Environment(tools = ['default', 'foo'], toolpath = ['tools'])
.EE

This looks for a tool specification in tools/foo.py (as well as
using the ordinary default tools for the platform).  foo.py should
have two functions: generate(env, **kw) and exists(env).
The
.B generate()
function
modifies the passed-in environment
to set up variables so that the tool
can be executed;
it may use any keyword arguments
that the user supplies (see below)
to vary its initialization.
The
.B exists()
function should return a true
value if the tool is available.
Tools in the toolpath are used before
any of the built-in ones.  For example, adding gcc.py to the toolpath
would override the built-in gcc tool.
Also note that the toolpath is
stored in the environment for use
by later calls to
.BR Copy ()
and
.BR Tool ()
methods:

.ES
base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
derived = base.Copy(tools=['custom_tool'])
derived.CustomBuilder()
.EE

The elements of the tools list may also
be functions or callable objects,
in which case the Environment() method
will call the specified elements
to update the new construction environment:

.ES
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools = [my_tool])
.EE

The individual elements of the tools list
may also themselves be two-element lists of the form
.RI ( toolname ", " kw_dict ).
SCons searches for the
.I toolname
specification file as described above, and
passes
.IR kw_dict ,
which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's
.B generate
function.
The
.B generate
function can use the arguments to modify the tool's behavior
by setting up the environment in different ways
or otherwise changing its initialization.

.ES
# in tools/my_tool.py:
def generate(env, **kw):
  # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword argument 'arg1' or 1.
  env['MY_TOOL'] = kw.get('arg1', '1')
def exists(env):
  return 1

# in SConstruct:
env = Environment(tools = ['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                  toolpath=['tools'])
.EE

The tool definition (i.e. my_tool()) can use the PLATFORM variable from
the environment it receives to customize the tool for different platforms.

If no tool list is specified, then SCons will auto-detect the installed
tools using the PATH variable in the ENV construction variable and the
platform name when the Environment is constructed. Changing the PATH
variable after the Environment is constructed will not cause the tools to
be redetected.

SCons supports the following tool specifications out of the box:

.EE

Additionally, there is a "tool" named
.B default
which configures the
environment with a default set of tools for the current platform.

On posix and cygwin platforms
the GNU tools (e.g. gcc) are preferred by SCons,
on Windows the Microsoft tools (e.g. msvc)
followed by MinGW are preferred by SCons,
and in OS/2 the IBM tools (e.g. icc) are preferred by SCons.

.SS Builder Methods

Build rules are specified by calling a construction
environment's builder methods.
The arguments to the builder methods are
.B target
(a list of target files)
and
.B source
(a list of source files).

Because long lists of file names
can lead to a lot of quoting,
.B scons
supplies a
.B Split()
global function
and a same-named environment method
that split a single string
into a list, separated on
strings of white-space characters.
(These are similar to the
string.split() method
from the standard Python library,
but work even if the input isn't a string.)

Like all Python arguments,
the target and source arguments to a builder method
can be specified either with or without
the "target" and "source" keywords.
When the keywords are omitted,
the target is first,
followed by the source.
The following are equivalent examples of calling the Program builder method:

.ES
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source =  ['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target = 'bar')
env.Program(target = 'bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target = 'bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source = string.split('bar.c foo.c'))
.EE

When the target shares the same base name
as the source and only the suffix varies,
and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type,
then the target argument may be omitted completely,
and
.B scons
will deduce the target file name from
the source file name.
The following examples all build the
executable program
.B bar
(on POSIX systems)
or 
.B bar.exe
(on Windows systems)
from the bar.c source file:

.ES
env.Program(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source = 'bar.c')
env.Program(source = 'bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')
.EE

It is possible to override or add construction variables when calling a
builder method by passing additional keyword arguments.
These overridden or added
variables will only be in effect when building the target, so they will not
affect other parts of the build. For example, if you want to add additional
libraries for just one program:

.ES
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])
.EE

or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:

.ES
env.SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp',
                  SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
                  LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'])
.EE

(Note that both the $SHLIBSUFFIX and $LIBSUFFIXES variables must be set
if you want SCons to search automatically
for dependencies on the non-standard library names;
see the descriptions of these variables, below, for more information.)

Although the builder methods defined by
.B scons
are, in fact,
methods of a construction environment object,
they may also be called without an explicit environment:

.ES
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')
.EE

In this case,
the methods are called internally using a default construction
environment that consists of the tools and values that
.B scons
has determined are appropriate for the local system.

Builder methods that can be called without an explicit
environment may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:

.ES
from SCons.Script import *
.EE

All builder methods return a list of Nodes
that represent the target or targets that will be built.
A
.I Node
is an internal SCons object
which represents
build targets or sources.

The returned Node(s)
can be passed to other builder methods as source(s)
or passed to any SCons function or method
where a filename would normally be accepted.
For example, if it were necessary
to add a specific
.B -D
flag when compiling one specific object file:

.ES
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
env.Program(source = ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])
.EE

Using a Node in this way
makes for a more portable build
by avoiding having to specify
a platform-specific object suffix
when calling the Program() builder method.

Note that Builder calls will automatically "flatten"
the source and target file lists,
so it's all right to have the bar_obj list
return by the StaticObject() call
in the middle of the source file list.
If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by Builders
directly using Python,
you can either build the list by hand:

.ES
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for object in objects:
    print str(object)
.EE

Or you can use the
.BR Flatten ()
supplied by scons
to create a list containing just the Nodes,
which may be more convenient:

.ES
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for object in objects:
    print str(object)
.EE

The path name for a Node's file may be used
by passing the Node to the Python-builtin
.B str()
function:

.ES
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
print "The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0])
.EE

Note again that because the Builder call returns a list,
we have to access the first element in the list
.B (bar_obj_list[0])
to get at the Node that actually represents
the object file.

Builder calls support a
.B chdir
keyword argument that
specifies that the Builder's action(s)
should be executed
after changing directory.
If the
.B chdir
argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
.B chdir
is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.

.ES
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
            chdir='sub')

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command.
env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in',
            "cp foo.in foo.out",
            chdir=1)
.EE

Note that scons will
.I not
automatically modify
its expansion of
construction variables like
.B $TARGET
and
.B $SOURCE
when using the chdir
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level SConstruct directory,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
If you use the chdir keyword argument,
you will typically need to supply a different
command line using
expansions like
.B ${TARGET.file}
and
.B ${SOURCE.file}
to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.

.B scons
provides the following builder methods:

All
targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
An explicit dependency can
be specified using the 
.B Depends 
method of a construction environment (see below).

In addition,
.B scons
automatically scans
source files for various programming languages,
so the dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly.
By default, SCons can
C source files,
C++ source files,
Fortran source files with
.B .F
(POSIX systems only),
.B .fpp,
or
.B .FPP
file extensions,
and assembly language files with
.B .S
(POSIX systems only),
.B .spp,
or
.B .SPP
files extensions
for C preprocessor dependencies.
SCons also has default support
for scanning D source files,
You can also write your own Scanners
to add support for additional source file types.
These can be added to the default
Scanner object used by
the
.BR Object ()
.BR StaticObject ()
and
.BR SharedObject ()
Builders by adding them
to the
.B SourceFileScanner
object as follows:

See the section "Scanner Objects,"
below, for a more information about
defining your own Scanner objects.

.SS Methods and Functions to Do Things
In addition to Builder methods,
.B scons
provides a number of other construction environment methods
and global functions to
manipulate the build configuration.

Usually, a construction environment method
and global function with the same name both exist
so that you don't have to remember whether
to a specific bit of functionality
must be called with or without a construction environment.
In the following list,
if you call something as a global function
it looks like:
.ES
.RI Function( arguments )
.EE
and if you call something through a construction
environment it looks like:
.ES
.RI env.Function( arguments )
.EE
If you can call the functionality in both ways,
then both forms are listed.

Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you
import into an SConscript file by adding the following
to the Python module:

.ES
from SCons.Script import *
.EE

Except where otherwise noted,
the same-named
construction environment method
and global function 
provide the exact same functionality.
The only difference is that,
where appropriate,
calling the functionality through a construction environment will
substitute construction variables into
any supplied strings.
For example:
.ES
env = Environment(FOO = 'foo')
Default('$FOO')
env.Default('$FOO')
.EE
the first call to the global
.B Default()
function will actually add a target named
.B $FOO
to the list of default targets,
while the second call to the
.B env.Default()
construction environment method
will expand the value
and add a target named
.B foo
to the list of default targets.
For more on construction variable expansion,
see the next section on
construction variables.

Construction environment methods
and global functions supported by
.B scons

.RI BuildDir( build_dir ", " src_dir ", [" duplicate ])
.TP
.RI env.BuildDir( build_dir ", " src_dir ", [" duplicate ])
This specifies a build directory
.I build_dir
in which to build all derived files
that would normally be built under
.IR src_dir .
Multiple build directories can be set up for multiple build variants, for
example. 
.I src_dir
must be underneath the SConstruct file's directory,
and
.I build_dir
may not be underneath the
.I src_dir .

The default behavior is for
.B scons
to duplicate all of the files in the tree underneath
.I src_dir
into
.IR build_dir ,
and then build the derived files within the copied tree.
(The duplication is performed by
linking or copying,
depending on the platform; see also the
.IR --duplicate
option.)
This guarantees correct builds
regardless of whether intermediate source files
are generated during the build,
where preprocessors or other scanners search
for included files,
or whether individual compilers or other invoked tools
are hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files.

This behavior of making a complete copy of the source tree
may be disabled by setting
.I duplicate
to 0.
This will cause
.B scons
to invoke Builders using the
path names of source files in
.I src_dir
and the path names of derived files within
.IR build_dir .
This is always more efficient than
.IR duplicate =1,
and is usually safe for most builds.
Specifying
.IR duplicate =0,
however,
may cause build problems
if source files are generated during the build,
if any invoked tools are hard-coded to
put derived files in the same directory as the source files.

Note that specifying a
.B BuildDir
works most naturally
with a subsidiary SConscript file
in the source directory.
However,
you would then call the subsidiary SConscript file
not in the source directory,
but in the
.I build_dir ,
as if
.B scons
had made a virtual copy of the source tree
regardless of the value of 
.IR duplicate .
This is how you tell
.B scons
which variant of a source tree to build.
For example:

.ES
BuildDir('build-variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build-variant1/SConscript')
BuildDir('build-variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build-variant2/SConscript')

among all the builds using the same
.BR CacheDir ()
call.

When a
.BR CacheDir ()
is being used and
.B scons
finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt,
it will first look in the cache to see if a
derived file has already been built
from identical input files and an identical build action
(as incorporated into the MD5 build signature).
If so,
.B scons
will retrieve the file from the cache.
If the derived file is not present in the cache,
.B scons
will rebuild it and
then place a copy of the built file in the cache
(identified by its MD5 build signature),
so that it may be retrieved by other
builds that need to build the same derived file
from identical inputs.

Use of a specified
.BR CacheDir()
may be disabled for any invocation
by using the
.B --cache-disable
option.

If the
.B --cache-force
option is used,
.B scons
will place a copy of

This is useful to populate a cache
the first time

.TP
.RI env.Command( target ", " source ", " action ", [" key = val ", ...])"
Executes a specific action
(or list of actions)
to build a target file or files.
This is more convenient
than defining a separate Builder object
for a single special-case build.

As a special case, the
.B source_scanner
keyword argument can
be used to specify
a Scanner object
that will be used to scan the sources.
(The global
.B DirScanner
object can be used
if any of the sources will be directories
that must be scanned on-disk for
changes to files that aren't
already specified in other Builder of function calls.)

Any other keyword arguments specified override any
same-named existing construction variables.

An action can be an external command,
specified as a string,
or a callable Python object;
see "Action Objects," below,
for more complete information.
Also note that a string specifying an external command
may be preceded by an
.B @
(at-sign)
to suppress printing the command in question,
or by a
.B \-
(hyphen)
to ignore the exit status of the external command.
Examples:

.ES
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            "$FOO_BUILD < $SOURCES > $TARGET")

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',

.RI env.SConscript(dirs= subdirs ", [name=" script ", " exports ", " build_dir ", " src_dir ", " duplicate ])
This tells
.B scons
to execute
one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files.
There are two ways to call the
.BR SConscript ()
function.

The first way you can call
.BR SConscript ()
is to explicitly specify one or more
.I scripts
as the first argument.
A single script may be specified as a string;
multiple scripts must be specified as a list
(either explicitly or as created by
a function like
.BR Split ()).

The second way you can call
.BR SConscript ()
is to specify a list of (sub)directory names
as a
.RI dirs= subdirs
keyword argument.
In this case,
.B scons
will, by default,
execute a subsidiary configuration file named
.B SConscript
in each of the specified directories.
You may specify a name other than
.B SConscript
by supplying an optional
.RI name= script
keyword argument.

The optional 
.I exports
argument provides a list of variable names or a dictionary of
named values to export to the
.IR script(s) ". "
These variables are locally exported only to the specified
.IR script(s) ,
and do not affect the
global pool of variables used by
the
.BR Export ()
function.
'\"If multiple dirs are provided,
'\"each script gets a fresh export.
The subsidiary
.I script(s)
must use the
.BR Import ()
function to import the variables.

The optional
.I build_dir
argument specifies that all of the target files
(for example, object files and executables)
that would normally be built in the subdirectory in which
.I script
resides should actually
be built in
.IR build_dir .
.I build_dir
is interpreted relative to the directory
of the calling SConscript file.

The optional
.I src_dir
argument specifies that the
source files from which
the target files should be built
can be found in
.IR src_dir .
.I src_dir
is interpreted relative to the directory
of the calling SConscript file.

By default,
.B scons
will link or copy (depending on the platform)
all the source files into the build directory.
This behavior may be disabled by
setting the optional
.I duplicate
argument to 0
(it is set to 1 by default),
in which case
.B scons
will refer directly to
the source files in their source directory
when building target files.
(Setting
.IR duplicate =0
is usually safe, and always more efficient
than the default of
.IR duplicate =1,
but it may cause build problems in certain end-cases,
such as compiling from source files that
are generated by the build.)

Any variables returned by 
.I script 
using 
.BR Return ()
will be returned by the call to
.BR SConscript (). 

Examples:

.ES
SConscript('subdir/SConscript')
foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='build', duplicate=0)
SConscript('bld/SConscript', src_dir='src', exports='env variable')

.EE

.TP
.RI SConscriptChdir( value )
.TP
.RI env.SConscriptChdir( value )
By default,
.B scons
changes its working directory
to the directory in which each
subsidiary SConscript file lives.
This behavior may be disabled
by specifying either:

.ES
SConscriptChdir(0)
env.SConscriptChdir(0)
.EE
.IP
in which case
.B scons
will stay in the top-level directory
while reading all SConscript files.
(This may be necessary when building from repositories,
when all the directories in which SConscript files may be found
don't necessarily exist locally.)

You may enable and disable
this ability by calling
SConscriptChdir()
multiple times:

.ES
env = Environment()
SConscriptChdir(0)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')	# will not chdir to foo
env.SConscriptChdir(1)

This tells

to store all file signatures

.IR file .
If the
.I file
name is omitted,
.B .sconsign
is used by default.
(The actual file name(s) stored on disk
may have an appropriated suffix appended
by the
.IR  dbm_module .)
If
.I file
is not an absolute path name,
the file is placed in the same directory as the top-level
.B SConstruct
file.

If
.I file
is
.BR None ,
then
.B scons
will store file signatures
in a separate
.B .sconsign
file in each directory,
not in one global database file.
(This was the default behavior
prior to SCons 0.96.91 and 0.97.)

The optional
.I dbm_module
argument can be used to specify
which Python database module
The default is to use a custom
.B SCons.dblite
module that uses pickled
Python data structures,
and which works on all Python versions from 1.5.2 on.

Examples:

.ES
# Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"

to be available for expansion.
This is usually necessary if you are

Construction variables must follow the same rules for

the initial character must be an underscore or letter,
followed by any number of underscores, letters, or digits.

A number of useful construction variables are automatically defined by
scons for each supported platform, and additional construction variables

.LP
Construction variables can be retrieved and set using the 
.B Dictionary 
method of the construction environment:

.ES
dict = env.Dictionary()
dict["CC"] = "cc"
.EE

or using the [] operator:

.ES
env["CC"] = "cc"
.EE

Construction variables can also be passed to the construction environment
constructor:

.ES
env = Environment(CC="cc")
.EE

or when copying a construction environment using the 
.B Copy 
method:

.ES
env2 = env.Copy(CC="cl.exe")
.EE

.SS Configure Contexts

.B scons
supports
.I configure contexts,
an integrated mechanism similar to the
various AC_CHECK macros in GNU autoconf
for testing for the existence of C header
files, libraries, etc.
In contrast to autoconf,
.B scons
does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values,
but uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values
up to date. However, users may override this behaviour with the 
.B --config
command line option.

The following methods can be used to perform checks:

.TP
.RI Configure( env ", [" custom_tests ", " conf_dir ", " log_file ", " config_h ])
.TP
.RI env.Configure([ custom_tests ", " conf_dir ", " log_file ", " config_h ])
This creates a configure context, which can be used to perform checks.
.I env
specifies the environment for building the tests.
This environment may be modified when performing checks.
.I custom_tests
is a dictionary containing custom tests.
See also the section about custom tests below. 
By default, no custom tests are added to the configure context.
.I conf_dir
specifies a directory where the test cases are built.
Note that this directory is not used for building
normal targets.
The default value is the directory
#/.sconf_temp.
.I log_file
specifies a file which collects the output from commands
that are executed to check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc.
The default is the file #/config.log.
If you are using the
.B BuildDir
method,
you may want to specify a subdirectory under your build directory.
.I config_h
specifies a C header file where the results of tests 
will be written, e.g. #define HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc. 
The default is to not write a
.B config.h
file.
You can specify the same
.B config.h
file in multiple calls to Configure,
in which case
.B scons
will concatenate all results in the specified file.
Note that SCons
uses its normal dependency checking
to decide if it's necessary to rebuild
the specified
.I config_h
file.
This means that the file is not necessarily re-built each
time scons is run,
but is only rebuilt if its contents will have changed
and some target that depends on the
.I config_h
file is being built.

.EE
A created
.B Configure
instance has the following associated methods:

.TP 
.RI Configure.Finish( self )
This method should be called after configuration is done.
It returns the environment as modified
by the configuration checks performed.
After this method is called, no further checks can be performed
with this configuration context.
However, you can create a new 
.RI Configure 
context to perform additional checks.
Only one context should be active at a time.

The following Checks are predefined.
(This list will likely grow larger as time
goes by and developers contribute new useful tests.)

.TP
.RI Configure.CheckHeader( self ", " header ", [" include_quotes ", " language ])
Checks if 
.I header
is usable in the specified language.
.I header
may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
.B #include
lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
The optional argument 
.I include_quotes 
must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote.
By default, both characters  are " (double quote).
The optional argument
.I language
should be either
.B C
or
.B C++
and selects the compiler to be used for the check.
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

.TP
.RI Configure.CheckCHeader( self ", " header ", [" include_quotes ])
This is a wrapper around
.B Configure.CheckHeader
which checks if 
.I header
is usable in the C language.
.I header
may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
.B #include
lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
The optional argument 
.I include_quotes 
must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote (both default
to \N'34').
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

.TP
.RI Configure.CheckCXXHeader( self ", " header ", [" include_quotes ])
This is a wrapper around
.B Configure.CheckHeader
which checks if 
.I header
is usable in the C++ language.
.I header
may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
.B #include
lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
The optional argument 
.I include_quotes 
must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote (both default
to \N'34').
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. 

.TP
.RI Configure.CheckFunc( self ", " function_name ", [" header ", " language ])
Checks if the specified
C or C++ function is available.
.I function_name
is the name of the function to check for.
The optional
.I header
argument is a string
that will be
placed at the top
of the test file
that will be compiled
to check if the function exists;
the default is:
.ES
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
#endif
char function_name();
.EE
The optional
.I language
argument should be
.B C
or
.B C++
and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is "C".

.TP 
.RI Configure.CheckLib( self ", [" library ", " symbol ", " header ", " language ", " autoadd=1 ])
Checks if 
.I library 
provides 
.IR symbol .
If the value of
.I autoadd
is 1 and the library provides the specified
.IR symbol ,
appends the library to the LIBS construction environment variable.
.I library 
may also be None (the default),
in which case 
.I symbol 
is checked with the current LIBS variable,
or a list of library names,
in which case each library in the list
will be checked for
.IR symbol .
The default
.I symbol
is "main",
which just check if
you can link against the specified
.IR library .
The optional
.I language
argument should be
.B C
or
.B C++
and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is "C".
The default value for
.I autoadd
is 1.
It is assumed, that the C-language is used.
This method returns 1 on success and 0 on error.

.TP 
.RI Configure.CheckLibWithHeader( self ", " library ", " header ", " language ", [" call ", " autoadd ])

In contrast to the 
.RI Configure.CheckLib 
call, this call provides a more sophisticated way to check against libraries.
Again, 
.I library
specifies the library or a list of libraries to check. 
.I header
specifies a header to check for.
.I header
may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
.B #include
lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
.I language
may be one of 'C','c','CXX','cxx','C++' and 'c++'.
.I call
can be any valid expression (with a trailing ';'). The default is 'main();'.
.I autoadd
specifies whether to add the library to the environment (only if the check 
succeeds). This method returns 1 on success and 0 on error.

.TP
.RI Configure.CheckType( self ", " type_name ", [" includes ", " language ])
Checks for the existence of a type defined by
.BR typedef .
.I type_name
specifies the typedef name to check for.
.I includes
is a string containing one or more
.B #include
lines that will be inserted into the program
that will be run to test for the existence of the type.
The optional
.I language
argument should be
.B C
or
.B C++
and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is "C".

.EE
Example of a typical Configure usage:

.ES
env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env )
if not conf.CheckCHeader( 'math.h' ):
    print 'We really need math.h!'
    Exit(1)
if conf.CheckLibWithHeader( 'qt', 'qapp.h', 'c++', 'QApplication qapp(0,0);' ):
    # do stuff for qt - usage, e.g.
    conf.env.Append( CPPFLAGS = '-DWITH_QT' )
env = conf.Finish() 
.EE

.EE
You can define your own custom checks. 
in addition to the predefined checks.
These are passed in a dictionary to the Configure function.
This dictionary maps the names of the checks
to user defined Python callables 
(either Python functions or class instances implementing the
.I __call__
method).
The first argument of the call is always a 
.I CheckContext
instance followed by the arguments,
which must be supplied by the user of the check.
These CheckContext instances define the following methods:

.TP 
.RI CheckContext.Message( self ", " text )

Usually called before the check is started. 
.I text
will be displayed to the user, e.g. 'Checking for library X...'

.TP
.RI CheckContext.Result( self, ", " res )

Usually called after the check is done. 
.I res
can be either an integer or a string. In the former case, 'ok' (res != 0) 
or 'failed' (res == 0) is displayed to the user, in the latter case the 
given string is displayed.

.TP
.RI CheckContext.TryCompile( self ", " text ", " extension )
Checks if a file with the specified 
.I extension
(e.g. '.c') containing 
.I text 
can be compiled using the environment's
.B Object 
builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

.TP 
.RI CheckContext.TryLink( self ", " text ", " extension )
Checks, if a file with the specified
.I extension
(e.g. '.c') containing 
.I text 
can be compiled using the environment's
.B Program
builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

.TP
.RI CheckContext.TryRun( self ", " text ", " extension )
Checks, if a file with the specified
.I extension
(e.g. '.c') containing 
.I text 
can be compiled using the environment's
.B Program
builder. On success, the program is run. If the program
executes successfully
(that is, its return status is 0),
a tuple
.I (1, outputStr)
is returned, where
.I outputStr
is the standard output of the
program.
If the program fails execution
(its return status is non-zero),
then (0, '') is returned.

.TP
.RI CheckContext.TryAction( self ", " action ", [" text ", " extension ])
Checks if the specified
.I action 
with an optional source file (contents
.I text
, extension 
.I extension
= ''
) can be executed. 
.I action 
may be anything which can be converted to a 
.B scons
.RI Action.
On success,
.I (1, outputStr)
is returned, where
.I outputStr
is the content of the target file.
On failure
.I (0, '')
is returned.

.TP
.RI CheckContext.TryBuild( self ", " builder ", [" text ", " extension ])
Low level implementation for testing specific builds;
the methods above are based on this method.
Given the Builder instance
.I builder
and the optional 
.I text
of a source file with optional
.IR extension ,
this method returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. In addition, 
.I self.lastTarget 
is set to the build target node, if the build was successful.

.EE
Example for implementing and using custom tests:

.ES
def CheckQt(context, qtdir):
    context.Message( 'Checking for qt ...' )
    lastLIBS = context.env['LIBS']
    lastLIBPATH = context.env['LIBPATH']
    lastCPPPATH= context.env['CPPPATH']
    context.env.Append(LIBS = 'qt', LIBPATH = qtdir + '/lib', CPPPATH = qtdir + '/include' )
    ret = context.TryLink("""
#include <qapp.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) { 
  QApplication qapp(argc, argv);
  return 0;
}
""")
    if not ret:
        context.env.Replace(LIBS = lastLIBS, LIBPATH=lastLIBPATH, CPPPATH=lastCPPPATH)
    context.Result( ret )
    return ret

env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env, custom_tests = { 'CheckQt' : CheckQt } )
if not conf.CheckQt('/usr/lib/qt'):
    print 'We really need qt!'
    Exit(1)
env = conf.Finish() 
.EE

.SS Construction Variable Options

Often when building software, various options need to be specified at build
time that are not known when the SConstruct/SConscript files are
written. For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non-standard
locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the
compiler. 
.B scons
provides a mechanism for overridding construction variables from the
command line or a text-based SConscript file through an Options
object. To create an Options object, call the Options() function:

.TP
.RI Options([ files "], [" args ])
This creates an Options object that will read construction variables from
the file or list of filenames specified in
.IR files .
If no files are specified,
or the
.I files
argument is
.BR None ,
then no files will be read.
The optional argument
.I args
is a dictionary of
values that will override anything read from the specified files;
it is primarily intended to be passed the
.B ARGUMENTS
dictionary that holds variables
specified on the command line.
Example:

.ES
opts = Options('custom.py')
opts = Options('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
opts = Options(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})
.EE

Options objects have the following methods:

.TP
.RI Add( key ", [" help ", " default ", " validator ", " converter ])
This adds a customizable construction variable to the Options object. 
.I key
is the name of the variable. 
.I help 
is the help text for the variable.
.I default 
is the default value of the variable;
if the default value is
.B None
and there is no explicit value specified,
the construction variable will
.I not
be added to the construction environment.
.I validator
is called to validate the value of the variable, and should take three
arguments: key, value, and environment
.I converter
is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and
should take a single argument: value. Example:

.ES
opts.Add('CC', 'The C compiler')
.EE

.TP
.RI AddOptions( list )
A wrapper script that adds
multiple customizable construction variables
to an Options object.
.I list
is a list of tuple or list objects
that contain the arguments
for an individual call to the
.B Add
method.

.ES
opt.AddOptions(
       ('debug', '', 0),
       ('CC', 'The C compiler'),
       ('VALIDATE', 'An option for testing validation',
        'notset', validator, None),
    )
.EE

.TP
.RI Update( env ", [" args ])
This updates a construction environment
.I env
with the customized construction variables. Normally this method is not
called directly, but is called indirectly by passing the Options object to
the Environment() function:

.ES
env = Environment(options=opts)
.EE

.IP
The text file(s) that were specified
when the Options object was created
are executed as Python scripts,
and the values of (global) Python variables set in the file
are added to the construction environment.
Example:

.ES
CC = 'my_cc'
.EE

.TP
.RI Save( filename ", " env )
This saves the currently set options into a script file named  
.I filename
that can be used on the next invocation to automatically load the current
settings.  This method combined with the Options method can be used to
support caching of options between runs.

.ES
env = Environment()
opts = Options(['options.cache', 'custom.py'])
opts.Add(...)
opts.Update(env)
opts.Save('options.cache', env)
.EE

.TP
.RI GenerateHelpText( env ", [" sort ])
This generates help text documenting the customizable construction
variables suitable to passing in to the Help() function. 
.I env
is the construction environment that will be used to get the actual values
of customizable variables. Calling with 
an optional
.I sort
function
will cause the output to be sorted
by the specified argument.
The specific
.I sort
function
should take two arguments
and return
-1, 0 or 1
(like the standard Python
.I cmp
function).

.ES
Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))
Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env, sort=cmp))
.EE

.TP
.RI FormatOptionHelpText( env ", " opt ", " help ", " default ", " actual )
This method returns a formatted string
containing the printable help text
for one option.
It is normally not called directly,
but is called by the
.IR GenerateHelpText ()
method to create the returned help text.
It may be overridden with your own
function that takes the arguments specified above
and returns a string of help text formatted to your liking.
Note that the
.IR GenerateHelpText ()
will not put any blank lines or extra
characters in between the entries,
so you must add those characters to the returned
string if you want the entries separated.

.ES
def my_format(env, opt, help, default, actual):
    fmt = "\n%s: default=%s actual=%s (%s)\n"
    return fmt % (opt, default. actual, help)
opts.FormatOptionHelpText = my_format
.EE

To make it more convenient to work with customizable Options,
.B scons
provides a number of functions
that make it easy to set up
various types of Options:

.TP
.RI BoolOption( key ", " help ", " default )
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up a Boolean option.
The option will use
the specified name
.IR key ,
have a default value of
.IR default ,
and display the specified
.I help
text.
The option will interpret the values
.BR y ,
.BR yes ,
.BR t ,
.BR true ,
.BR 1 ,
.B on
and
.B all
as true,
and the values
.BR n ,
.BR no ,
.BR f ,
.BR false ,
.BR 0 ,
.B off
and
.B none
as false.

.TP
.RI EnumOption( key ", " help ", " default ", " allowed_values ", [" map ", " ignorecase ])
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value may be one
of a specified list of legal enumerated values.
The option will use
the specified name
.IR key ,
have a default value of
.IR default ,
and display the specified
.I help
text.
The option will only support those
values in the
.I allowed_values
list.
The optional
.I map
argument is a dictionary
that can be used to convert
input values into specific legal values
in the
.I allowed_values
list.
If the value of
.I ignore_case
is
.B 0
(the default),
then the values are case-sensitive.
If the value of
.I ignore_case
is
.BR 1 ,
then values will be matched
case-insensitive.
If the value of
.I ignore_case
is
.BR 1 ,
then values will be matched
case-insensitive,
and all input values will be
converted to lower case.

.TP
.RI ListOption( key ", " help ", " default ", " names ", [", map ])
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value may be one or more
of a specified list of legal enumerated values.
The option will use
the specified name
.IR key ,
have a default value of
.IR default ,
and display the specified
.I help
text.
The option will only support the values
.BR all ,
.BR none ,
or the values in the
.I names
list.
More than one value may be specified,
with all values separated by commas.
The default may be a string of
comma-separated default values,
or a list of the default values.
The optional
.I map
argument is a dictionary
that can be used to convert
input values into specific legal values
in the
.I names
list.

.TP
.RI PackageOption( key ", " help ", " default )
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value is a path name
of a package that may be
enabled, disabled or 
given an explicit path name.
The option will use
the specified name
.IR key ,
have a default value of
.IR default ,
and display the specified
.I help
text.
The option will support the values
.BR yes ,
.BR true ,
.BR on ,
.BR enable
or
.BR search ,
in which case the specified
.I default
will be used,
or the option may be set to an
arbitrary string
(typically the path name to a package
that is being enabled).
The option will also support the values
.BR no ,
.BR false ,
.BR off
or
.BR disable
to disable use of the specified option.

.TP
.RI PathOption( key ", " help ", " default ", [" validator ])
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up an option
whose value is expected to be a path name.
The option will use
the specified name
.IR key ,
have a default value of
.IR default ,
and display the specified
.I help
text.
An additional
.I validator
may be specified
that will be called to
verify that the specified path
is acceptable.
SCons supplies the
following ready-made validators:
.BR PathOption.PathExists
(the default),
which verifies that the specified path exists;
.BR PathOption.PathIsFile ,
which verifies that the specified path is an existing file;
.BR PathOption.PathIsDir ,
which verifies that the specified path is an existing directory;
and
.BR PathOption.PathIsDirCreate ,
which verifies that the specified path is a directory,
and will create the specified directory if the path does not exist.
You may supply your own
.I validator
function,
which must take three arguments
.RI ( key ,
the name of the options variable to be set;
.IR val ,
the specified value being checked;
and
.IR env ,
the construction environment)
and should raise an exception
if the specified value is not acceptable.

.RE
These functions make it
convenient to create a number
of options with consistent behavior
in a single call to the
.B AddOptions
method:

.ES
opts.AddOptions(
    BoolOption('warnings', 'compilation with -Wall and similiar', 1),
    EnumOption('debug', 'debug output and symbols', 'no'
               allowed_values=('yes', 'no', 'full'),
               map={}, ignorecase=0),  # case sensitive
    ListOption('shared',
               'libraries to build as shared libraries',
               'all',
               names = list_of_libs),
    PackageOption('x11',
                  'use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)',
                  'yes'),
    PathOption('qtdir', 'where the root of Qt is installed', qtdir),
    PathOption('foopath', 'where the foo library is installed', foopath,
               PathOption.PathIsDir),

)
.EE

.SS File and Directory Nodes

The
.IR File ()
and
.IR Dir ()
functions return
.I File
and
.I Dir
Nodes, respectively.
python objects, respectively.
Those objects have several user-visible attributes
and methods that are often useful:

.IP path
The build path
of the given
file or directory.
This path is relative to the top-level directory
(where the
.B SConstruct
file is found).
The build path is the same as the source path if
.I build_dir
is not being used.

.IP abspath
The absolute build path of the given file or directory.

.IP srcnode()
The
.IR srcnode ()
method
returns another
.I File
or
.I Dir
object representing the
.I source
path of the given
.I File
or
.IR Dir .
The 

.ES
# Get the current build dir's path, relative to top.
Dir('.').path
# Current dir's absolute path
Dir('.').abspath
# Next line is always '.', because it is the top dir's path relative to itself.
Dir('#.').path
File('foo.c').srcnode().path   # source path of the given source file.

# Builders also return File objects:
foo = env.Program('foo.c')
print "foo will be built in %s"%foo.path
.EE

.SH EXTENDING SCONS
.SS Builder Objects
.B scons
can be extended to build different types of targets
by adding new Builder objects
to a construction environment.
.IR "In general" ,
you should only need to add a new Builder object
when you want to build a new type of file or other external target.
If you just want to invoke a different compiler or other tool
to build a Program, Object, Library, or any other
type of output file for which
.B scons
already has an existing Builder,
it is generally much easier to
use those existing Builders
in a construction environment
that sets the appropriate construction variables
(CC, LINK, etc.).

Builder objects are created
using the
.B Builder 
function.
The
.B Builder
function accepts the following arguments:

.IP action
The command line string used to build the target from the source. 
.B action
can also be:
a list of strings representing the command
to be executed and its arguments
(suitable for enclosing white space in an argument),
a dictionary
mapping source file name suffixes to
any combination of command line strings
(if the builder should accept multiple source file extensions),
a Python function;
an Action object
(see the next section);
or a list of any of the above.

An action function
takes three arguments:
.I source 
- a list of source nodes, 
.I target
- a list of target nodes,
.I env
- the construction environment.

.IP prefix 
The prefix that will be prepended to the target file name.
This may be specified as a:

.RS 10
.HP 6
* 
.IR string ,

.HP 6
* 
.I callable object
- a function or other callable that takes
two arguments (a construction environment and a list of sources)
and returns a prefix,

.HP 6
* 
.I dictionary
- specifies a mapping from a specific source suffix (of the first 
source specified) to a corresponding target prefix.  Both the source
suffix and target prefix specifications may use environment variable
substitution, and the target prefix (the 'value' entries in the
dictionary) may also be a callable object.  The default target prefix
may be indicated by a dictionary entry with a key value of None.

.IP suffix
The suffix that will be appended to the target file name.
This may be specified in the same manner as the prefix above.
If the suffix is a string, then
.B scons
will append a '.' to the beginning of the suffix if it's not already
there.  The string returned by callable object (or obtained from the

.EE

.IP src_suffix
The expected source file name suffix.  This may be a string or a list
of strings.

.IP target_scanner
A Scanner object that
will be invoked to find
implicit dependencies for this target file.
This keyword argument should be used
for Scanner objects that find
implicit dependencies
based only on the target file
and the construction environment,
.I not 
for implicit
(See the section "Scanner Objects," below,
for information about creating Scanner objects.)

.IP source_scanner
A Scanner object that
will be invoked to
find implicit dependences in
any source files
used to build this target file.
This is where you would
specify a scanner to
find things like
.B #include
lines in source files.
The pre-built
.B DirScanner
Scanner object may be used to
indicate that this Builder
should scan directory trees
for on-disk changes to files
that
.B scons
does not know about from other Builder or function calls.
(See the section "Scanner Objects," below,
for information about creating your own Scanner objects.)

.IP target_factory
A factory function that the Builder will use
to turn any targets specified as strings into SCons Nodes.
By default,
SCons assumes that all targets are files.
Other useful target_factory
values include
.BR Dir ,
for when a Builder creates a directory target,
and
.BR Entry ,
for when a Builder can create either a file
or directory target.

Example:

.ES
MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'MakeDirectory':MakeDirectoryBuilder})
env.MakeDirectory('new_directory', [])
.EE

Note that the call to the MakeDirectory Builder
needs to specify an empty source list
to make the string represent the builder's target;
without that, it would assume the argument is the source,
and would try to deduce the target name from it,
which in the absence of an automatically-added prefix or suffix
would lead to a matching target and source name
and a circular dependency.

.IP source_factory
A factory function that the Builder will use
to turn any sources specified as strings into SCons Nodes.
By default,
SCons assumes that all source are files.
Other useful source_factory
values include
.BR Dir ,
for when a Builder uses a directory as a source,
and
.BR Entry ,
for when a Builder can use files
or directories (or both) as sources.

Example:

.ES
CollectBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, source_factory=Entry)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Collect':CollectBuilder})
env.Collect('archive', ['directory_name', 'file_name'])
.EE

.IP emitter
A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and source
lists before dependencies are established
and the target(s) are actually built.
.B emitter
can also be a string containing a construction variable to expand
to an emitter function or list of functions,
or a dictionary mapping source file suffixes
to emitter functions.
(Only the suffix of the first source file
is used to select the actual emitter function
from an emitter dictionary.)

An emitter function
takes three arguments:
.I source 
- a list of source nodes, 
.I target
- a list of target nodes,
.I env
- the construction environment.
An emitter must return a tuple containing two lists,
the list of targets to be built by this builder,
and the list of sources for this builder.

Example:

.ES
def e(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['foo.foo'], source + ['foo.src'])

# Simple association of an emitter function with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = e)

def e2(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['bar.foo'], source + ['bar.src'])

# Simple association of a list of emitter functions with a Builder.
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = [e, e2])

# Calling an emitter function through a construction variable.
env = Environment(MY_EMITTER = e)
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = '$MY_EMITTER')

# Calling a list of emitter functions through a construction variable.
env = Environment(EMITTER_LIST = [e, e2])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = '$EMITTER_LIST')

# Associating multiple emitters with different file
# suffixes using a dictionary.
def e_suf1(target, source, env):
    return (target + ['another_target_file'], source)
def e_suf2(target, source, env):
    return (target, source + ['another_source_file'])
b = Builder("my_build < $TARGET > $SOURCE",
            emitter = {'.suf1' : e_suf1,
                       '.suf2' : e_suf2})
.EE

.IP multi
Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple times for
the same target file(s). The default is 0, which means the builder
can not be called multiple times for the same target file(s). Calling a
builder multiple times for the same target simply adds additional source
files to the target; it is not allowed to change the environment associated
with the target, specify addition environment overrides, or associate a different
builder with the target. 

.IP env
A construction environment that can be used
to fetch source code using this Builder.
(Note that this environment is
.I not
used for normal builds of normal target files,
which use the environment that was
used to call the Builder for the target file.)

.IP generator
A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed to build
the target(s) from the source(s).
The returned action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that
can be converted into an Action object
(see the next section).

The generator function
takes four arguments:
.I source 
- a list of source nodes, 
.I target
- a list of target nodes,
.I env
- the construction environment,
.I for_signature
- a Boolean value that specifies
whether the generator is being called
for generating a build signature
(as opposed to actually executing the command).
Example:

.ES
def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return [["gcc", "-c", "-o"] + target + source] 

b = Builder(generator=g)
.EE

.IP
The 
.I generator
and
.I action
arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.

.IP src_builder
Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does not match
any of the suffixes of the builder. Using this argument produces a
multi-stage builder.

.IP single_source
Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per call. Giving
more than one source files without target files results in implicitely calling
the builder multiple times (once for each source given). Giving multiple 
source files together with target files results in a UserError exception.

.RE
.IP
The 
.I generator
and
.I action
arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.

.IP env
A construction environment that can be used
to fetch source code using this Builder.
(Note that this environment is
.I not
used for normal builds of normal target files,
which use the environment that was
used to call the Builder for the target file.)

.ES
b = Builder(action="build < $SOURCE > $TARGET")
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg = 'xyzzy')
.EE

.IP chdir
A directory from which scons
will execute the
action(s) specified
for this Builder.
If the
.B chdir
argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the
.B chdir
is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.

Note that scons will
.I not
automatically modify
its expansion of
construction variables like
.B $TARGET
and
.B $SOURCE
when using the chdir
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level SConstruct directory,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
Builders created using chdir keyword argument,
will need to use construction variable
expansions like
.B ${TARGET.file}
and
.B ${SOURCE.file}
to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.

.ES
b = Builder(action="build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
            chdir=1)
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in')
.EE

.RE
Any additional keyword arguments supplied
when a Builder object is created
(that is, when the Builder() function is called)
will be set in the executing construction
environment when the Builder object is called.
The canonical example here would be
to set a construction variable to 
the repository of a source code system.

Any additional keyword arguments supplied
when a Builder
.I object
is called
will only be associated with the target
created by that particular Builder call
(and any other files built as a
result of the call).

These extra keyword arguments are passed to the
following functions:
command generator functions,
function Actions,
and emitter functions.

.SS Action Objects

The
.BR Builder()
function will turn its
.B action
keyword argument into an appropriate
internal Action object.
You can also explicity create Action objects
using the
.BR Action ()
global function,
which can then be passed to the
.BR Builder ()
function.
This can be used to configure
an Action object more flexibly,
or it may simply be more efficient
than letting each separate Builder object
create a separate Action
when multiple
Builder objects need to do the same thing.

The
.BR Action ()
global function
returns an appropriate object for the action
represented by the type of the first argument:

.IP Action
If the first argument is already an Action object,
the object is simply returned.

.IP String
If the first argument is a string,
a command-line Action is returned.
Note that the command line string
may be preceded by an
.B @
(at-sign)
to suppress printing of the
specified command line,
or by a
.B \-
(hyphen)
to ignore the exit status from
the specified command.
Examples:

.ES
Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Doesn't print the line being executed.
Action('@build $TARGET $SOURCES')

# Ignores
Action('-build $TARGET $SOURCES')
.EE

.\" XXX From Gary Ruben, 23 April 2002:
.\" What would be useful is a discussion of how you execute command
.\" shell commands ie. what is the process used to spawn the shell, pass
.\" environment variables to it etc., whether there is one shell per
.\" environment or one per command etc.  It might help to look at the Gnu
.\" make documentation to see what they think is important to discuss about
.\" a build system. I'm sure you can do a better job of organising the
.\" documentation than they have :-)


.IP List
If the first argument is a list,
then a list of Action objects is returned.
An Action object is created as necessary
for each element in the list.
If an element
.I within
the list is itself a list,
the internal list is the
command and arguments to be executed via
the command line.
This allows white space to be enclosed
in an argument by defining
a command in a list within a list:

.ES
Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])
.EE

.IP Function
If the first argument is a Python function,
a function Action is returned.
The Python function takes three keyword arguments,
.B target
(a Node object representing the target file),
.B source
(a Node object representing the source file)
and
.B env
(the construction environment
used for building the target file).
The
.B target
and
.B source
arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
more than one target file or source file.
The actual target and source file name(s) may
be retrieved from their Node objects
via the built-in Python str() function:

.ES
target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = map(lambda x: str(x), source)
.EE
.IP
The function should return
.B 0
or
.B None
to indicate a successful build of the target file(s).
The function may raise an exception
or return a non-zero exit status
to indicate an unsuccessful build.

.ES
def build_it(target = None, source = None, env = None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0
 
a = Action(build_it)
.EE

If the action argument is not one of the above,
None is returned.

The second, optional argument
is a Python function that returns
a string to be printed to describe the action being executed.
Like a function to build a file,
this function takes three arguments:
.B target
(a Node object representing the target file),
.B source
(a Node object representing the source file)
and
.BR env
(a construction environment).
The
.B target
and
.B source
arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
more than one target file or source file.
Examples:

.ES
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument.
a = Action(build_it, string_it)

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
.EE

The third, also optional argument
is a list of construction variables
whose values will be included
in the signature of the Action
when deciding whether a target should
be rebuilt because the action changed.
This is necessary whenever you want a target to
be rebuilt when a specific
construction variable changes,
because the underlying Python code for a function
will not change when the value of the construction variable does.

.ES
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    open(target[0], 'w').write(env['XXX'])
    return 0

def string_it(target, source):
    return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, string_it, ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])
.EE
.PP

The
.BR Action ()
global function
also takes a
.B chdir
keyword argument
which specifies that
scons will execute the action
after changing to the specified directory.
If the chdir argument is
a string or a directory Node,
scons will change to the specified directory.
If the chdir argument
is not a string or Node
and is non-zero,
then scons will change to the
target file's directory.

Note that scons will
.I not
automatically modify
its expansion of
construction variables like
.B $TARGET
and
.B $SOURCE
when using the chdir
keyword argument--that is,
the expanded file names
will still be relative to
the top-level SConstruct directory,
and consequently incorrect
relative to the chdir directory.
Builders created using chdir keyword argument,
will need to use construction variable
expansions like
.B ${TARGET.file}
and
.B ${SOURCE.file}
to use just the filename portion of the
targets and source.

.ES
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
           chdir=1)
.EE

The
.BR Action ()
global function
also takes an
.B exitstatfunc
keyword argument
which specifies a function
that is passed the exit status
(or return value)
from the specified action
and can return an arbitrary
or modified value.
This can be used, for example,
to specify that an Action object's
return value should be ignored
and SCons should, therefore,
consider that the action always suceeds:

.ES
def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success.
    return 0
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE.file} > ${TARGET.file}",
           exitstatfunc=always_succeed)
.EE

.SS Miscellaneous Action Functions

.B scons
supplies a number of functions
that arrange for various common
file and directory manipulations
to be performed.
These are similar in concept to "tasks" in the 
Ant build tool,
although the implementation is slightly different.
These functions do not actually
perform the specified action
at the time the function is called,
but instead return an Action object
that can be executed at the
appropriate time.
(In Object-Oriented terminology,
these are actually
Action
.I Factory
functions
that return Action objects.)

In practice,
there are two natural ways
that these
Action Functions
are intended to be used.

First,
if you need
to perform the action
at the time the SConscript
file is being read,
you can use the
.B Execute
global function to do so:
.ES
Execute(Touch('file'))
.EE

Second,
you can use these functions
to supply Actions in a list
for use by the
.B Command
method.
This can allow you to
perform more complicated
sequences of file manipulation
without relying
on platform-specific
external commands:
that 
.ES
env = Environment(TMPBUILD = '/tmp/builddir')
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Mkdir('$TMPBUILD'),
             Copy('$TMPBUILD', '${SOURCE.dir}')
             "cd $TMPBUILD && make",
             Delete('$TMPBUILD')])
.EE

.TP
.RI Chmod( dest ", " mode )
Returns an Action object that
changes the permissions on the specified
.I dest
file or directory to the specified
.IR mode .
Examples:

.ES
Execute(Chmod('file', 0755))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', 0755)])
.EE

.TP
.RI Copy( dest ", " src )
Returns an Action object
that will copy the
.I src
source file or directory to the
.I dest
destination file or directory.
Examples:

.ES
Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',
            Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))
.EE

.TP
.RI Delete( entry ", [" must_exist ])
Returns an Action that
deletes the specified
.IR entry ,
which may be a file or a directory tree.
If a directory is specified,
the entire directory tree
will be removed.
If the
.I must_exist
flag is set,
then a Python error will be thrown
if the specified entry does not exist;
the default is
.BR must_exist=0 ,
that is, the Action will silently do nothing
if the entry does not exist.
Examples:

.ES
Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),
             MyBuildAction])

Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=1))
.EE

.TP
.RI Mkdir( dir )
Returns an Action
that creates the specified
directory
.I dir .
Examples:

.ES
Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/outputdir'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Mkdir('/tmp/builddir',
             Copy('$SOURCE', '/tmp/builddir')
             "cd /tmp/builddir && ])

.EE

.TP
.RI Move( dest ", " src )
Returns an Action
that moves the specified
.I src
file or directory to
the specified
.I dest
file or directory.
Examples:

.ES
Execute(Move('file.destination', 'file.source'))

env.Command('output_file', 'input_file',
            [MyBuildAction,
             Move('$TARGET', 'file_created_by_MyBuildAction')])
.EE

.TP
.RI Touch( file )
Returns an Action
that updates the modification time
on the specified
.IR file .
Examples:

.ES
Execute(Touch('file_to_be_touched'))

env.Command('marker', 'input_file',
            [MyBuildAction,
             Touch('$TARGET')])
.EE

.SS Variable Substitution

Before executing a command,
.B scons
performs construction variable interpolation on the strings that make up
the command line of builders.
Variables are introduced by a
.B $
prefix.
Besides construction variables, scons provides the following
variables for each command execution:

.IP TARGET
The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the first 
target if multiple targets are being built.

.IP TARGETS
The file names of all targets being built.

.IP SOURCE
The file name of the source of the build command, or the file name of the
first source if multiple sources are being built.

.IP SOURCES
The file names of the sources of the build command.

(Note that the above variables are reserved
and may not be set in a construction environment.)

.LP 
For example, given the construction variable CC='cc', targets=['foo'], and
sources=['foo.c', 'bar.c']:

.ES
action='$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'
.EE

would produce the command line:

.ES
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c
.EE

Variable names may be surrounded by curly braces ({})
to separate the name from the trailing characters.
Within the curly braces, a variable name may have
a Python slice subscript appended to select one
or more items from a list.
In the previous example, the string:

.ES
${SOURCES[1]}
.EE

would produce:

.ES
bar.c
.EE

Additionally, a variable name may
have the following special
modifiers appended within the enclosing curly braces
to modify the interpolated string:

.IP base
The base path of the file name,
including the directory path
but excluding any suffix.

.IP dir
The name of the directory in which the file exists.

.IP file
The file name,
minus any directory portion.

.IP filebase
Just the basename of the file,
minus any suffix
and minus the directory.

.IP suffix
Just the file suffix.

.IP abspath
The absolute path name of the file.

.IP posix
The POSIX form of the path,
with directories separated by
.B /
(forward slashes)
not backslashes.
This is sometimes necessary on Windows systems
when a path references a file on other (POSIX) systems.

.IP srcpath
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory and filename unchanged.

.IP srcdir
The directory containing the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory part of the filename.

.IP rsrcpath
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If the file does not exist locally but exists in
a Repository, the path in the Repository is returned.
If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory and filename unchanged.

.IP rsrcdir
The Repository directory containing the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory part of the filename.

.LP
For example, the specified target will
expand as follows for the corresponding modifiers:

.ES
$TARGET              => sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       => sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        => sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       => file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   => file
${TARGET.suffix}     => .x
${TARGET.abspath}    => /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x

SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='sub/dir')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    => src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     => src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   => /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    => /usr/repository/src
.EE

Lastly, a variable name
may be a callable Python function
associated with a
construction variable in the environment.
The function should
take four arguments:
.I target
- a list of target nodes,
.I source 
- a list of source nodes, 
.I env
- the construction environment,
.I for_signature
- a Boolean value that specifies
whether the function is being called
for generating a build signature.
SCons will insert whatever
the called function returns
into the expanded string:

.ES
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")
.EE

You can use this feature to pass arguments to a
Python function by creating a callable class
that stores one or more arguments in an object,
and then uses them when the
.B __call__()
method is called.
Note that in this case,
the entire variable expansion must
be enclosed by curly braces
so that the arguments will
be associated with the
instantiation of the class:

.ES
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")
.EE

.LP
The special pseudo-variables
.B "$("
and
.B "$)"
may be used to surround parts of a command line
that may change
.I without
causing a rebuild--that is,
which are not included in the signature
of target files built with this command.
All text between
.B "$("
and
.B "$)"
will be removed from the command line
before it is added to file signatures,
and the
.B "$("
and
.B "$)"
will be removed before the command is executed.
For example, the command line:

.ES
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). > $TARGET
.EE

.LP
would execute the command:

.ES
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. > $TARGET
.EE

.LP
but the command signature added to any target files would be:

.ES
echo Last build occurred  . > $TARGET
.EE

SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables into
command lines:

.IP String
When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space delimited list of
command line arguments. 

.IP List
When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line
arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a string.

.IP Other
Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and
interpreted as a single command line argument.

.IP Newline
Newline characters (\\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is done after
all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e.g. file names) to
contain embedded newline characters. This limitation will likely go away in
a future version of SCons.

.SS Scanner Objects

You can use the
.B Scanner
function to define
objects to scan
new file types for implicit dependencies.
Scanner accepts the following arguments:

.IP function
A Python function that will process
the Node (file)
and return a list of strings (file names)
representing the implicit
dependencies found in the contents.
The function takes three or four arguments:

    def scanner_function(node, env, path):

    def scanner_function(node, env, path, arg):

The
.B node
argument is the internal
SCons node representing the file.
Use
.B str(node)
to fetch the name of the file, and
.B node.get_contents()
to fetch contents of the file.

The
.B env
argument is the construction environment for the scan.
Fetch values from it using the
.B env.Dictionary()
method.

The
.B path
argument is a tuple (or list)
of directories that can be searched
for files.
This will usually be the tuple returned by the
.B path_function
argument (see below).

The
.B arg
argument is the argument supplied
when the scanner was created, if any.

.IP name
The name of the Scanner.
This is mainly used
to identify the Scanner internally.

.IP argument
An optional argument that, if specified,
will be passed to the scanner function
(described above)
and the path function
(specified below).

.IP skeys
An optional list that can be used to
determine which scanner should be used for
a given Node.
In the usual case of scanning for file names,
this argument will be a list of suffixes
for the different file types that this
Scanner knows how to scan.
If the argument is a string,
then it will be expanded 
into a list by the current environment.

.IP path_function
A Python function that takes
two or three arguments:
a construction environment, directory Node,
and optional argument supplied
when the scanner was created.
The
.B path_function
returns a tuple of directories
that can be searched for files to be returned
by this Scanner object.

.IP node_class
The class of Node that should be returned
by this Scanner object.
Any strings or other objects returned
by the scanner function
that are not of this class
will be run through the
.B node_factory
function.

.IP node_factory
A Python function that will take a string
or other object
and turn it into the appropriate class of Node
to be returned by this Scanner object.

.IP scan_check
An optional Python function that takes two arguments,
a Node (file) and a construction environment,
and returns whether the
Node should, in fact,
be scanned for dependencies.
This check can be used to eliminate unnecessary
calls to the scanner function when,
for example, the underlying file
represented by a Node does not yet exist.

.IP recursive
An optional flag that
specifies whether this scanner should be re-invoked
on the dependency files returned by the scanner.
When this flag is not set,
the Node subsystem will
only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned,
and not (for example) also on the files
specified by the #include lines
in the file being scanned.
.I recursive
may be a callable function,
in which case it will be called with a list of
Nodes found and
should return a list of Nodes
that should be scanned recursively;
this can be used to select a specific subset of
Nodes for additional scanning.

Note that
.B scons
has a global
.B SourceFileScanner
object that is used by
the
.BR Object (),
.BR SharedObject (),
and 
.BR StaticObject ()
builders to decide
which scanner should be used
for different file extensions.
You can using the
.BR SourceFileScanner.add_scanner ()
method to add your own Scanner object
to the
.B scons
infrastructure
that builds target programs or
libraries from a list of
source files of different types:

.ES
def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
    contents = node.get_contents()
    # Scan the contents and return the included files.

XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyx', XYZScanner)

env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])
.EE

.SH SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR
SCons and its configuration files are very portable,
due largely to its implementation in Python.
There are, however, a few portability
issues waiting to trap the unwary.
.SS .C file suffix
SCons handles the upper-case
.B .C
file suffix differently,
depending on the capabilities of
the underlying system.
On a case-sensitive system
such as Linux or UNIX,
SCons treats a file with a 
.B .C
suffix as a C++ source file.
On a case-insensitive system
such as Windows,
SCons treats a file with a 
.B .C
suffix as a C source file.
.SS .F file suffix
SCons handles the upper-case
.B .F
file suffix differently,
depending on the capabilities of
the underlying system.
On a case-sensitive system
such as Linux or UNIX,
SCons treats a file with a 
.B .F
suffix as a Fortran source file
that is to be first run through
the standard C preprocessor.
On a case-insensitive system
such as Windows,
SCons treats a file with a 
.B .F
suffix as a Fortran source file that should
.I not
be run through the C preprocessor.
.SS Windows:  Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons
Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities
that let users work on a
Windows system using a more POSIX-like environment.
The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python,
do this, in part,
by sharing an ability to interpret UNIX-like path names.
For example, the Cygwin tools
will internally translate a Cygwin path name
like /cygdrive/c/mydir
to an equivalent Windows pathname
of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\\mydir).

Versions of Python
that are built for native Windows execution,
such as the python.org and ActiveState versions,
do not have the Cygwin path name semantics.
This means that using a native Windows version of Python
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools
(such as gcc, bison, and flex)
may yield unpredictable results.
"Mixing and matching" in this way
can be made to work,
but it requires careful attention to the use of path names
in your SConscript files.

In practice, users can sidestep
the issue by adopting the following rules:
When using gcc,
use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter
to run SCons;
when using Microsoft Visual C/C++
(or some other Windows compiler)
use the python.org or ActiveState version of Python
to run SCons.
.SS Windows:  scons.bat file
On Windows systems,
SCons is executed via a wrapper
.B scons.bat
file.
This has (at least) two ramifications:

First, Windows command-line users
that want to use variable assignment
on the command line
may have to put double quotes
around the assignments:

.ES
scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"
.EE

Second, the Cygwin shell does not
recognize this file as being the same
as an
.B scons
command issued at the command-line prompt.
You can work around this either by
executing
.B scons.bat
from the Cygwin command line,
or by creating a wrapper shell
script named
.B scons .

.SS MinGW

The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or the
PATH variable under the ENV construction variable for SCons
to detect and use the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows
Python interpreter, SCons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin
tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
directories in the PATH variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC,
then you must explictly tell SCons to use MinGW by passing 

.ES
tools=['mingw']
.EE

to the Environment() function, because SCons will prefer the MSVC tools
over the MinGW tools.

.SH EXAMPLES

To help you get started using SCons,
this section contains a brief overview of some common tasks.

.SS Basic Compilation From a Single Source File

.ES
env = Environment()
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')
.EE

Note:  Build the file by specifying
the target as an argument
("scons foo" or "scons foo.exe").
or by specifying a dot ("scons .").

.SS Basic Compilation From Multiple Source Files

.ES
env = Environment()
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = Split('f1.c f2.c f3.c'))
.EE

.SS Setting a Compilation Flag

.ES
env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')
.EE

.SS Search The Local Directory For .h Files

Note:  You do
.I not
need to set CCFLAGS to specify -I options by hand.
SCons will construct the right -I options from CPPPATH.

.ES
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['.'])
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')
.EE

.SS Search Multiple Directories For .h Files

.ES
env = Environment(CPPPATH = ['include1', 'include2'])
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')
.EE

.SS Building a Static Library

.ES
env = Environment()
env.StaticLibrary(target = 'foo', source = Split('l1.c l2.c'))
env.StaticLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['l3.c', 'l4.c'])
.EE

.SS Building a Shared Library

.ES
env = Environment()
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'foo', source = ['l5.c', 'l6.c'])
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = Split('l7.c l8.c'))
.EE

.SS Linking a Local Library Into a Program

.ES
env = Environment(LIBS = 'mylib', LIBPATH = ['.'])
env.Library(target = 'mylib', source = Split('l1.c l2.c'))
env.Program(target = 'prog', source = ['p1.c', 'p2.c'])
.EE

.SS Defining Your Own Builder Object

Notice that when you invoke the Builder,
you can leave off the target file suffix,
and SCons will add it automatically.

.ES
bld = Builder(action = 'pdftex < $SOURCES > $TARGET'
              suffix = '.pdf',
              src_suffix = '.tex')
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'PDFBuilder' : bld})
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'foo.pdf', source = 'foo.tex')

# The following creates "bar.pdf" from "bar.tex"
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'bar', source = 'bar')
.EE

Note also that the above initialization
overwrites the default Builder objects,
so the Environment created above
can not be used call Builders like env.Program(),
env.Object(), env.StaticLibrary(), etc.

.SS Adding Your Own Builder Object to an Environment

.ES
bld = Builder(action = 'pdftex < $SOURCES > $TARGET'
              suffix = '.pdf',
              src_suffix = '.tex')
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'PDFBuilder' : bld})
env.PDFBuilder(target = 'foo.pdf', source = 'foo.tex')
env.Program(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.c')
.EE

You also can use other Pythonic techniques to add
to the BUILDERS construction variable, such as:

.ES
env = Environment()
env['BUILDERS]['PDFBuilder'] = bld
.EE

.SS Defining Your Own Scanner Object

.ES
import re

'\" Note:  the \\ in the following are for the benefit of nroff/troff,
'\" not inappropriate doubled escape characters within the r'' raw string.
include_re = re.compile(r'^include\\s+(\\S+)$', re.M)

def kfile_scan(node, env, path, arg):
    contents = node.get_contents()
    includes = include_re.findall(contents)
    return includes

kscan = Scanner(name = 'kfile',
                function = kfile_scan,
                argument = None,
                skeys = ['.k'])
scanners = Environment().Dictionary('SCANNERS')
env = Environment(SCANNERS = scanners + [kscan])

env.Command('foo', 'foo.k', 'kprocess < $SOURCES > $TARGET')

bar_in = File('bar.in')
env.Command('bar', bar_in, 'kprocess $SOURCES > $TARGET')
bar_in.target_scanner = kscan
.EE

.SS Creating a Hierarchical Build

Notice that the file names specified in a subdirectory's
SConscript
file are relative to that subdirectory.

.ES
SConstruct:

    env = Environment()
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

    SConscript('sub/SConscript')

sub/SConscript:

    env = Environment()
    # Builds sub/foo from sub/foo.c
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

    SConscript('dir/SConscript')

sub/dir/SConscript:

    env = Environment()
    # Builds sub/dir/foo from sub/dir/foo.c
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')
.EE

.SS Sharing Variables Between SConscript Files

You must explicitly Export() and Import() variables that
you want to share between SConscript files.

.ES
SConstruct:

    env = Environment()
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')

    Export("env")
    SConscript('subdirectory/SConscript')

subdirectory/SConscript:

    Import("env")
    env.Program(target = 'foo', source = 'foo.c')
.EE

.SS Building Multiple Variants From the Same Source

Use the build_dir keyword argument to
the SConscript function to establish
one or more separate build directories for
a given source directory:

.ES
SConstruct:

    cppdefines = ['FOO']
    Export("cppdefines")
    SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='foo')

    cppdefines = ['BAR']
    Export("cppdefines")
    SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='bar')

src/SConscript:

    Import("cppdefines")
    env = Environment(CPPDEFINES = cppdefines)
    env.Program(target = 'src', source = 'src.c')
.EE

Note the use of the Export() method
to set the "cppdefines" variable to a different
value each time we call the SConscript function.

.SS Hierarchical Build of Two Libraries Linked With a Program

.ES
SConstruct:

    env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['#libA', '#libB'])
    Export('env')
    SConscript('libA/SConscript')
    SConscript('libB/SConscript')
    SConscript('Main/SConscript')

libA/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    env.Library('a', Split('a1.c a2.c a3.c'))

libB/SConscript:                                                  

    Import('env')
    env.Library('b', Split('b1.c b2.c b3.c'))

Main/SConscript:

    Import('env')
    e = env.Copy(LIBS = ['a', 'b'])
    e.Program('foo', Split('m1.c m2.c m3.c'))
.EE

The '#' in the LIBPATH directories specify that they're relative to the
top-level directory, so they don't turn into "Main/libA" when they're
used in Main/SConscript.

Specifying only 'a' and 'b' for the library names
allows SCons to append the appropriate library
prefix and suffix for the current platform
(for example, 'liba.a' on POSIX systems,
'a.lib' on Windows).

.SS Customizing contruction variables from the command line.

The following would allow the C compiler to be specified on the command
line or in the file custom.py. 

.ES
opts = Options('custom.py')
opts.Add('CC', 'The C compiler.')
env = Environment(options=opts)
Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))
.EE

The user could specify the C compiler on the command line:

.ES
scons "CC=my_cc"
.EE

or in the custom.py file:

.ES
CC = 'my_cc'
.EE

or get documentation on the options:

.ES
$ scons -h

CC: The C compiler.
    default: None
    actual: cc

.EE

.SS Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers

Since windows.h includes everything and the kitchen sink, it can take quite
some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so
Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then
include the previously compiled headers in any object file. This
technology is called precompiled headers. The general recipe is to create a
file named "StdAfx.cpp" that includes a single header named "StdAfx.h", and
then include every header you want to precompile in "StdAfx.h", and finally
include "StdAfx.h" as the first header in all the source files you are
compiling to object files. For example:

StdAfx.h:
.ES
#include <windows.h>
#include <my_big_header.h>
.EE

StdAfx.cpp:
.ES
#include <StdAfx.h>
.EE

Foo.cpp:
.ES
#include <StdAfx.h>

/* do some stuff */
.EE

Bar.cpp:
.ES
#include <StdAfx.h>

/* do some other stuff */
.EE

SConstruct:
.ES
env=Environment()
env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'
env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])
.EE

For more information see the document for the PCH builder, and the PCH and
PCHSTOP construction variables. To learn about the details of precompiled
headers consult the MSDN documention for /Yc, /Yu, and /Yp.

.SS Using Microsoft Visual C++ external debugging information

Since including debugging information in programs and shared libraries can
cause their size to increase significantly, Microsoft provides a mechanism
for including the debugging information in an external file called a PDB
file. SCons supports PDB files through the PDB construction
variable. 

SConstruct:
.ES
env=Environment()
env['PDB'] = 'MyApp.pdb'
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])
.EE

For more information see the document for the PDB construction variable.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP SCONS_LIB_DIR
Specifies the directory that contains the SCons Python module directory
(e.g. /home/aroach/scons-src-0.01/src/engine).

.IP SCONSFLAGS
A string of options that will be used by scons in addition to those passed
on the command line.
