  &scons; supports the following environment variables to affect
  its behavior:

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
    <term>
      &SCONSFLAGS;
    </term>
    <listitem>
      <para>

        &SCons; reads and interprets command-line options from this
        environment variable before interpreting the options actually
        supplied on the command line.  Where there's a conflict, options
        from the command line overrule options from the &SCONSFLAGS;
        environment variable.  Unknown options and other errors in the
        &SCONSFLAGS; variable are ignored with a warning, but do not
        halt &SCons;.
