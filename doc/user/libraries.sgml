  <para>

  It's often useful to organize large software projects
  by collecting parts of the software into one or more libraries.
  &SCons; makes it easy to create libraries
  and to use them in the programs.

  </para>

  <section>
  <title>Building Libraries</title>

    <para>

    You build your own libraries by specifying &Library;
    instead of &Program;:

    </para>

    <programlisting>
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    &SCons; uses the appropriate library prefix and suffix for your system.
    So on POSIX or Linux systems,
    the above example would build as follows
    (although &ranlib; may not be called on all systems):

    </para>

    <literallayout>
      % <userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
      cc -c -o f1.o f1.c
      cc -c -o f2.o f2.c
      cc -c -o f3.o f3.c
      ar r libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a
    </literallayout>

    <para>

    On a Windows system,
    a build of the above example would look like:

    </para>

    <literallayout>
      C:\><userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
      cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
      cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
      cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
      lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
    </literallayout>

    <para>

    The rules for the target name of the library
    are similar to those for programs:
    if you don't explicitly specify a target library name,
    &SCons; will deduce one from the
    name of the first source file specified,
    and &SCons; will add an appropriate
    file prefix and suffix if you leave them off.

    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Linking with Libraries</title>

    <para>

    Usually, you build a library
    because you want to link it with one or more programs.
    You link libraries with a program by specifying
    the libraries in the &LIBS; construction variable,
    and by specifying the directory in which
    the library will be found in the 
    &LIBPATH; construction variable:

    </para>

    <programlisting>
      Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
      Program('prog.c', LIBS='foo', LIBPATH='.')
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    Notice, of course, that you don't need to specify a library
    prefix (like <literal>lib</literal>)
    or suffix (like <literal>.a</literal> or <literal>.lib</literal>).
    &SCons; uses the correct prefix or suffix for the current system.

    </para>

    <para>

    On a POSIX or Linux system,
    a build of the above example would look like:

    </para>

    <literallayout>
      % <userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
      cc -c -o f1.o f1.c
      cc -c -o f2.o f2.c
      cc -c -o f3.o f3.c
      ar r libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
      ranlib libfoo.a
      cc -c -o prog.o prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -L. -lfoo
    </literallayout>

    <para>

    On a Windows system,
    a build of the above example would look like:

    </para>

    <literallayout>
      C:\><userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
      cl /nologo /c f1.c /Fof1.obj
      cl /nologo /c f2.c /Fof2.obj
      cl /nologo /c f3.c /Fof3.obj
      lib /nologo /OUT:foo.lib f1.obj f2.obj f3.obj
      cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:. foo.lib prog.obj
    </literallayout>

    <para>

    As usual, notice that &SCons; has taken care
    of constructing the correct command lines
    to link with the specified library on each system.

    </para>

  </section>

  <section>
  <title>Finding Libraries:  the &LIBPATH; Construction Variable</title>

    <para>

    By default, the linker will only look in
    certain system-defined directories for libraries.
    &SCons; knows how to look for libraries
    in directories that you specify with the
    &LIBPATH; construction variable.
    &LIBPATH; consists of a list of
    directory names, like so:

    </para>

    <programlisting>
      Program('prog.c', LIBS = 'm',
                        LIBPATH = ['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    Using a Python list is preferred because it's portable
    across systems.  Alternatively, you could put all of
    the directory names in a single string, separated by the
    system-specific path separator character:
    a colon on POSIX systems:

    </para>

    <programlisting>
      LIBPATH = '/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib'
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    or a semi-colon on Windows systems:

    </para>

    <programlisting>
      LIBPATH = 'C:\lib;D:\lib'
    </programlisting>

    <para>

    When the linker is executed,
    &SCons; will create appropriate flags
    so that the linker will look for
    libraries in the same directories as &SCons;.
    So on a POSIX or Linux system,
    a build of the above example would look like:

    </para>

    <literallayout>
      % <userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
      cc -c -o prog.o prog.c
      cc -o prog prog.o -L/usr/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lm
    </literallayout>

    <para>

    On a Windows system,
    a build of the above example would look like:

    </para>

    <literallayout>
      C:\><userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
      cl /nologo /c prog.c /Foprog.obj
      link /nologo /OUT:prog.exe /LIBPATH:\usr\lib /LIBPATH:\usr\local\lib m.lib prog.obj
    </literallayout>

    <para>

    Note again that &SCons; has taken care of
    the system-specific details of creating
    the right command-line options.

    </para>
