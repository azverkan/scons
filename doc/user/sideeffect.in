 <para>

 If &SCons; is unaware that a build step produces an extra file,
 the &SideEffect; method can be used to identify it,
 so that the file can be used as a dependency in subsequent build steps.
 However, the primary use for the &SideEffect; method
 is to prevent two build steps from simultaneously modifying the same file.

 </para>

 <para>

 If more than one build step creates or manipulates the same file,
 it can cause unpleasant results if both build steps are run at the same time.
 The shared file is declared as a side-effect of building the primary targets
 and &SCons; will prevent the two build steps from running in parallel.

 </para>

 <para>

 In this example, the <filename>SConscript</filename> uses
 &SideEffect; to inform &SCons; about the additional output file.

 </para>

 <scons_example name="SideEffectSimple">
   <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
    env = Environment()
    env.Command('file2', 'log', 'cat >$TARGET $SOURCE')
    env.SideEffect('log', env.Command('file1', [],
        'echo >$TARGET data1; echo >log updated file1'))
   </file>
 </scons_example>

 <para>

 Even when run in parallel mode, &SCons; will run the two steps in order:

 </para>

 <scons_output example="SideEffectSimple">
    <scons_output_command>scons -Q --jobs=2</scons_output_command>
 </scons_output>

 <para>

 If the same file is modified by two build steps,
 &SideEffect; will cause the steps to be run separately:

 </para>

 <scons_example name="SideEffectShared">
   <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
    env = Environment()
    f1 = env.Command('file1', [],
        'echo >$TARGET data1; echo >>log updated file1')
    f2 = env.Command('file2', [],
        'echo >$TARGET data2; echo >>log updated file2')
    env.SideEffect('log', f1 + f2)
   </file>
 </scons_example>

 <scons_output example="SideEffectShared">
    <scons_output_command>scons -Q --jobs=2</scons_output_command>
 </scons_output>

 <para>

 Despite the <filename>--jobs=2</filename> in the command line,
 the two build steps are run sequentially.

 </para>

 <para>

 The name used as a side-effect need not ever exist:

 </para>

 <scons_example name="SideEffectParallel">
   <file name="SConstruct" printme="1">
    env = Environment()
    f1 = env.Command('file1', [], 'echo >$TARGET data1')
    env.SideEffect('log', f1)
    f2 = env.Command('file2', [], 'echo >$TARGET data2')
    env.SideEffect('log', f2)
   </file>
 </scons_example>

 <scons_output example="SideEffectParallel">
    <scons_output_command>scons -Q --jobs=2</scons_output_command>
 </scons_output>

 <para>

 Again, the two build steps are run sequentially.

 </para>
