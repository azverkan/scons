=head1 Default targets

Until now, we've demonstrated invoking Cons with an explicit target
to build:

  % cons hello

Normally, Cons does not build anything unless a target is specified,
but specifying '.' (the current directory) will build everything:

  % cons		# does not build anything

  % cons .		# builds everything under the top-level directory

Adding the C<Default> method to any F<Construct> or F<Conscript> file will add
the specified targets to a list of default targets.  Cons will build
these defaults if there are no targets specified on the command line.
So adding the following line to the top-level F<Construct> file will mimic
Make's typical behavior of building everything by default:

  Default '.';

The following would add the F<hello> and F<goodbye> commands (in the
same directory as the F<Construct> or F<Conscript> file) to the default list:

  Default qw(
	hello
	goodbye
  );

The C<Default> method may be used more than once to add targets to the
default list.
