=head2 The C<Precious> method

The C<Precious> method asks cons not to delete the specified file or
list of files before building them again.  It is invoked as:

  Precious <files>;

This is especially useful for allowing incremental updates to libraries
or debug information files which are updated rather than rebuilt anew each
time.  Cons will still delete the files when the C<-r> flag is specified.

=head2 The C<AfterBuild> method

The C<AfterBuild> method evaluates the specified perl string after
building the given file or files (or finding that they are up to date).
The eval will happen once per specified file.  C<AfterBuild> is called
as follows:

  AfterBuild $env 'foo.o', qq(print "foo.o is up to date!\n");

The perl string is evaluated in the C<script> package, and has access
to all variables and subroutines defined in the F<Conscript> file in
which the C<AfterBuild> method is called.
