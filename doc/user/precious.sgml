=head2 The C<AfterBuild> method

The C<AfterBuild> method evaluates the specified perl string after
building the given file or files (or finding that they are up to date).
The eval will happen once per specified file.  C<AfterBuild> is called
as follows:

  AfterBuild $env 'foo.o', qq(print "foo.o is up to date!\n");

The perl string is evaluated in the C<script> package, and has access
to all variables and subroutines defined in the F<Conscript> file in
which the C<AfterBuild> method is called.

 <para>

 By default, &SCons; removes targets before building them.
 Sometimes, however, this is not what you want.
 For example, you may want to update a library incrementally,
 not by having it deleted and then rebuilt from all
 of the constituent object files.
 In such cases, you can use the
 &Precious; method to prevent
 &SCons; from removing the target before it is built:

 </para>

 <programlisting>
    env = Environment()
    lib = env.Library('foo', ['f1.c', 'f2.c', 'f3.c'])
    env.Precious(lib)
 </programlisting>

 <para>

 Although the output doesn't look any different,
 &SCons; does not, in fact,
 delete the target library before rebuilding it:

 </para>

 <literallayout>
    % <userinput>scons -Q</userinput>
    cc -c -o f1.o f1.c
    cc -c -o f2.o f2.c
    cc -c -o f3.o f3.c
    ar r libfoo.a f1.o f2.o f3.o
    ranlib libfoo.a
 </literallayout>

 <para>

 &SCons; will, however, still delete files marked as &Precious;
 when the <literal>-c</literal> option is used.

 </para>
