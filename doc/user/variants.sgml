=head1 Variant builds


=head2 Hello, World! for baNaNa and peAcH OS's

Variant builds require just another simple extension. Let's take as an
example a requirement to allow builds for both the baNaNa and peAcH
operating systems. In this case, we are using a distributed file system,
such as NFS to access the particular system, and only one or the other of
the systems has to be compiled for any given invocation of C<cons>. Here's
one way we could set up the F<Construct> file for our B<Hello, World!>
application:

  # Construct file for Hello, World!

  die qq(OS must be specified) unless $OS = $ARG{OS};
  die qq(OS must be "peach" or "banana")
	if $OS ne "peach" && $OS ne "banana";

  # Where to put all our shared products.
  $EXPORT = "#export/$OS";

  Export qw( CONS INCLUDE LIB BIN );

  # Standard directories for sharing products.
  $INCLUDE = "$EXPORT/include";
  $LIB = "$EXPORT/lib";
  $BIN = "$EXPORT/bin";

  # A standard construction environment.
  $CONS = new cons (
	CPPPATH => $INCLUDE,	# Include path for C Compilations
	LIBPATH => $LIB,	# Library path for linking programs
	LIBS => '-lworld',	# List of standard libraries
  );

  # $BUILD is where we will derive everything.
  $BUILD = "#build/$OS";

  # Tell cons where the source files for $BUILD are.
  Link $BUILD => 'src';

  Build (
	"$BUILD/hello/Conscript",
	"$BUILD/world/Conscript",
  );

Now if we login to a peAcH system, we can build our B<Hello, World!>
application for that platform:

  % cons export OS=peach
  Install build/peach/world/world.h as export/peach/include/world.h
  cc -Iexport/peach/include -c build/peach/hello/hello.c -o build/peach/hello/hello.o
  cc -Iexport/peach/include -c build/peach/world/world.c -o build/peach/world/world.o
  ar r build/peach/world/libworld.a build/peach/world/world.o
  ar: creating build/peach/world/libworld.a
  ranlib build/peach/world/libworld.a
  Install build/peach/world/libworld.a as export/peach/lib/libworld.a
  cc -o build/peach/hello/hello build/peach/hello/hello.o -Lexport/peach/lib -lworld
  Install build/peach/hello/hello as export/peach/bin/hello


=head2 Variations on a theme

Other variations of this model are possible. For example, you might decide
that you want to separate out your include files into platform dependent and
platform independent files. In this case, you'd have to define an
alternative to C<$INCLUDE> for platform-dependent files. Most F<Conscript>
files, generating purely platform-independent include files, would not have
to change.

You might also want to be able to compile your whole system with debugging
or profiling, for example, enabled. You could do this with appropriate
command line options, such as C<DEBUG=on>. This would then be translated
into the appropriate platform-specific requirements to enable debugging
(this might include turning off optimization, for example). You could
optionally vary the name space for these different types of systems, but, as
we'll see in the next section, it's not B<essential> to do this, since Cons
is pretty smart about rebuilding things when you change options.

  <para>

  The &BuildDir; function now gives us everything
  we need to show how easy it is to create
  variant builds using &SCons;.
  Suppose, for example, that we want to
  build a program for both Windows and Linux platforms,
  but that we want to build it in a shared directory
  with separate side-by-side build directories
  for the Windows and Linux versions of the program.

  </para>

  <programlisting>
    platform = ARGUMENT.get('OS', Platform())

    include = "#export/$PLATFORM/include"
    lib = "#export/$PLATFORM/lib"
    bin = "#export/$PLATFORM/bin"

    env = Environment(PLATFORM = platform,
                      CPPPATH = [include],
                      LIB = lib,
                      LIBS = '-lworld')

    Export('env')

    SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='build/$PLATFORM')

    #
    #BuildDir("#build/$PLATFORM", 'src')
    #SConscript("build/$PLATFORM/hello/SConscript")
    #SConscript("build/$PLATFORM/world/SConscript")
  </programlisting>

  <para>

  This SConstruct file,
  when run on a Linux system, yields:

  </para>

  <literallayout>
    $ <userinput>scons OS=linux</userinput>
    Install build/linux/world/world.h as export/linux/include/world.h
    cc -Iexport/linux/include -c build/linux/hello/hello.c -o build/linux/hello/hello.o
    cc -Iexport/linux/include -c build/linux/world/world.c -o build/linux/world/world.o
    ar r build/linux/world/libworld.a build/linux/world/world.o
    ar: creating build/linux/world/libworld.a
    ranlib build/linux/world/libworld.a
    Install build/linux/world/libworld.a as export/linux/lib/libworld.a
    cc -o build/linux/hello/hello build/linux/hello/hello.o -Lexport/linux/lib -lworld
    Install build/linux/hello/hello as export/linux/bin/hello
  </literallayout>

  <para>

  The same SConstruct file on Windows would build:

  </para>

    <!--

    Install build\linux\hello\hello.exe as export\linux\bin\hello.exe
  </literallayout>

  <programlisting>
    env = Environment(OS = )
    for os in ['newell', 'post']:
        SConscript('src/SConscript', build_dir='build/' + os)
