=head2 The C<Install> method

The C<Install> method arranges for the specified files to be installed in
the specified directory. The installation is optimized: the file is not
copied if it can be linked. If this is not the desired behavior, you will
need to use a different method to install the file. It is called as follows:

  Install $env <directory>, <names>;

Note that, while the files to be installed may be arbitrarily named,
only the last component of each name is used for the installed target
name. So, for example, if you arrange to install F<foo/bar> in F<baz>,
this will create a F<bar> file in the F<baz> directory (not F<foo/bar>).


=head2 The C<InstallAs> method

The C<InstallAs> method arranges for the specified source file(s) to be
installed as the specified target file(s). Multiple files should be
specified as a file list. The installation is optimized: the file is not
copied if it can be linked. If this is not the desired behavior, you will
need to use a different method to install the file. It is called as follows:

C<InstallAs> works in two ways:

Single file install:

  InstallAs $env TgtFile, SrcFile;

Multiple file install:

  InstallAs $env ['tgt1', 'tgt2'], ['src1', 'src2'];

Or, even as:

  @srcs = qw(src1 src2 src3);
  @tgts = qw(tgt1 tgt2 tgt3);
  InstallAs $env [@tgts], [@srcs];

Both the target and the sources lists should be of the same length.
