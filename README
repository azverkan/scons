Welcome to the SCons development tree.  Here's a brief guide (not
guaranteed to be up-to-date) to what you'll find herein:

admin/
	Documentation of SCons administrative procedures.  Maybe
	other administrative stuff in the future.

build/
        This doesn't exist if you're looking at a vanilla source tree.
        This is generated as part of our build process, and it's where,
        believe it or not, we *build* everything.

Construct
        The "Makefile" for the SCons distribution.  Yes, we're using
        Cons to build its improved stepchild.  (Of course, this will
        change to an SConstruct file as soon as we have SCons to the
        point where it can handle the functionality we need...)

config
        The Aegis configuration, governing much of how we use Aegis to
        build, test, control source, etc.

etc/
        A subdirectory for miscellaneous things that we need.  Right
        now, it has copies of Python modules that we use for testing,
        and which we don't want to force people to have to install on
        their own just to help out with SCons development.

runtest.py
runtest.sh
        Scripts for running our tests.  The Python version is used
        by Aegis for running tests against a copy of the source as
        extracted from an archive.  The shell version runs tests against
        the local src/ tree, so you don't have to do a build before
        testing your changes.  (Hmm, that should probably just be an
        option to runtest.py...)

src/
	Where the actual source code is kept, of course.

template/
        Template files, used by Aegis to give you a head start when you
        aenf or aent a new file.  I haven't been keeping these up to
	date...

test/
        End-to-end tests of the SCons utility itself.  These are
        separate from the individual module unit tests, which live
        side-by-side with the modules under src/.
