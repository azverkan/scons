>Preface</H1
><P
>&#13;  Thank you for taking the time to read about <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>.
  <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> is a next-generation
  software construction tool,
  or make tool--that is, a software utility
  for building software (or other files)
  and keeping built software up-to-date
  whenever the underlying input files change.

  </P
><P
>&#13;  The most distinctive thing about <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>
  is that its configuration files are
  actually <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>scripts</I
>,
  written in the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Python</TT
> programming language.
  This is in contrast to most alternative build tools,
  which typically invent a new language to
  configure the build.
  <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> still has a learning curve, of course,
  because you have to know what functions to call
  to set up your build properly,
  but the underlying syntax used should be familiar
  to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

  </P
><P
>&#13;  Paradoxically,
  using Python as the configuration file format
  makes <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>
  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>easier</I
>
  for non-programmers to learn
  than the cryptic languages of other build tools,
  which are usally invented by programmers for other programmers.
  This is in no small part to the
  consistency and readability that are built in to Python.
  It just so happens that making a real, live
  scripting language the basis for the
  configuration files
  makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers
  to do more complicated things with builds,
  as necessary.

>Why <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>?</H1
><P
>&#13;    <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> is a response to a perennial problem:
    building software is harder than it should be.
    In a nutshell:  the old, reliable model of the
    venerable and ubiquitous <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Make</TT
> program
    has had a hard time keeping up with
    how complicated building software has become.
    The fact that <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Make</TT
> has kept up as well as it has is impressive,
    and a testament to how the simplicity.
    But anyone who has wrestled with <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Automake</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Autoconf</TT
>
    to try to guarantee that a bit of software
    will build correctly on multiple platforms
    can tell you that it takes a lot of work to get right.
