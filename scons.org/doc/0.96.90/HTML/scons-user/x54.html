>A Caveat About This Guide's Completeness</H1
><P
>&#13;  One word of warning as you read through this Guide:
  Like too much Open Source software out there,
  the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> documentation isn't always
  kept up-to-date with the available features.
  In other words,
  there's a lot that <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> can do that
  isn't yet covered in this User's Guide.
  (Come to think of it,
  that also describes a lot of proprietary software, doesn't it?)

  </P
><P
>&#13;  Although this User's Guide isn't as complete as we'd like it to be,
  our development process does emphasize
  making sure that the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> man page is kept up-to-date
  with new features.
  So if you're trying to figure out how to do something
  that <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> supports
  but can't find enough (or any) information here,
  it would be worth your while to look
  at the man page to see if the information is covered there.
  And if you do,
  maybe you'd even consider contributing
  a section to the User's Guide
  so the next person looking for
  that information won't have to
  go through the same thing...?
