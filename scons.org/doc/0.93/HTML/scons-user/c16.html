>Preface</H1
><P
>&#13;  Thank you for taking the time to read about <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>.
  <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> is a next-generation
  software construction tool,
  or make tool--that is, a software utility
  for building software (or other files)
  and keeping built software up-to-date
  whenever the underlying input files change.

  </P
><P
>&#13;  The most distinctive thing about <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>
  is that its configuration files are
  actually <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>scripts</I
>,
  written in the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Python</TT
> programming language.
  This is in contrast to most alternative build tools,
  which typically invent a new language to
  configure the build.
  <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> still has a learning curve, of course,
  because you have to know what functions to call
  to set up your build properly,
  but the underlying syntax used should be familiar
  to anyone who has ever looked at a Python script.

  </P
><P
>&#13;  Paradoxically,
  using Python as the configuration file format
  makes <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>
  <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>easier</I
>
  for non-programmers to learn
  than the cryptic languages of other build tools,
  which are usually invented by programmers for other programmers.
  This is in no small part due to the
  consistency and readability that are built in to Python.
  It just so happens that making a real, live
  scripting language the basis for the
  configuration files
  makes it a snap for more accomplished programmers
  to do more complicated things with builds,
  as necessary.

>&#13;      First and foremost,
      by default, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> guarantees a correct build
      even if it means sacrificing performance a little.
      We strive to guarantee the build is correct
      regardless of how the software being built is structured,
      how it may have been written,
      or how unusual the tools are that build it.

><P
>&#13;      Given that the build is correct,
      we try to make <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> build software
      as quickly as possible.
      In particular, wherever we may have needed to slow
      down the default <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> behavior to guarantee a correct build,
      we also try to make it easy to speed up <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
>
      through optimization options that let you trade off
      guaranteed correctness in all end cases for
      a speedier build in the usual cases.

      and using them correctly to build the software.

>&#13;    In a nutshell, we try hard to make <TT

    "do the right thing" and build software correctly,
