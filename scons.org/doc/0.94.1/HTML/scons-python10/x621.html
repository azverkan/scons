>&#13;          Given the popularity of Java, support for it would greatly

          users.

        </P

>&#13;          Good support for Java is, however, a tricky
          proposition. Because the Java compiler can make decisions
          about compiling other files based on what classes it finds
          in a file, it behaves "unpredictably" from the point of
          view of an outside build tool like <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Make</TT
>. Some
          sort of sophisticated scanning of Java source code to
          identify what other classes are likely to be compiled
          would be an obvious first step, but notice that here
          <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT
> would be scanning the file to find additional
          targets to be built. This is the inverse of the sort of
          <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#include</TT
> scanning performed
          for C files, in which <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT

          <I

          associated with Software Carpentry, it still shares the
          same goal: to make programming easier for more than just

          help a great many physical scientists and other computer

>Database Interface</H2
><P
>&#13;    The Nodes in an <TT

> dependency graph aren't only restricted to
    files. Creating an interface to mSQL or MySQL databases would allow
    the possibility of updating external files in response to changes in
    database fields, or vice versa. This could be handy, for example,
    for generating a cache of static web pages from a database that only
    need re-generating when the appropriate database objects change.

>&#13;    Because the <TT

    Engine for its dependency analysis.

  </P

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make++</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>makepp</TT
>)
    is a Perl implementation of just such a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile</TT
> interpreter. It
    could possible serve as a model for a Python version, in much the
    same way the <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cons</TT
