>&#13;  <TT

  implemented in Python, which uses Python scripts as "configuration
  files" for software builds. Based on the design which won the
  Software Carpentry build tool competition, <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT

  problems associated with other build tools, especially including the
  classic and ubiquitous <TT

><P
>&#13;  Distinctive features of <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>SCons</TT

  lends itself to being embedded in other applications; a global
  view of all dependencies in the source tree; an improved model for
  parallel (<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>-j</TT
>) builds; automatic scanning of files for
  dependencies; use of MD5 signatures for deciding whether a file
  is up-to-date; use of traditional file timestamps instead of
  MD5 signatures available as an option;
  use of Python functions or objects to build target files; easy user
  extensibility.&#13;</P

>Enter Software Carpentry</H2
><P
>&#13;    Most of the build tools just mentioned
    were written by programmers and for
    programmers. The fact that most programmer-friendly
    utilities do a poor job of fulfilling the needs
    of non-programmers prompted Greg Wilson to
    organize the Software Carpentry competition in January 2000.
    Software Carpentry was an
    open design contest with the express goal of producing a set of
    next-generation utilities, including a build tool, that would be
    accessible
    not only to
    programmers
    but also to computer <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>users</I
>
    such as physical scientists.

  </P
><P
>&#13;    The key to this usability would be that all of
    these utilities, including the build tool, would be
    written in Python.
    This provided the catalyst for actually
    pursuing an idea
    that had been floating around one of the more
    intriguing <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Make</TT
> alternatives,
    a Perl utility called <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cons</TT
>.
    What if the friendlier syntax of Python
    could be married to the
    architectural advantages of <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Cons</TT
>?

  </P
><P
>&#13;    The resulting merged design, at that time named <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>ScCons</TT
>,
    won the Software Carpentry build tool competition. CodeSourcery (by
    then the administrators of the competition) ultimately decided not to
    fund development of the build tool, but the seed had been planted and the
    design had taken root.
