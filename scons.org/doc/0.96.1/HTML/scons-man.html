<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
The 
<B>scons </B>

utility builds software (or other files) by determining which
component pieces must be rebuilt and executing the necessary commands to
rebuild them.
<P>
By default, 
<B>scons </B>

searches for a file named 
<I>SConstruct</I>,

<I>Sconstruct</I>,

or
<I>sconstruct</I>

(in that order) in the current directory and reads its
configuration from the first file found.
An alternate file name may be
specified via the 
<B>-f</B>

option.
<P>
The
<I>SConstruct</I>

file can specify subsidiary
configuration files using the
<B>SConscript()</B>

function.
By convention,
these subsidiary files are named
<I>SConscript</I>,

although any name may be used.
(Because of this naming convention,
the term &quot;SConscript files&quot;
is sometimes used to refer
generically to all
<B>scons</B>

configuration files,
regardless of actual file name.)
<P>
The configuration files
specify the target files to be built, and
(optionally) the rules to build those targets.  Reasonable default
rules exist for building common software components (executable
programs, object files, libraries), so that for most software
projects, only the target and input files need be specified.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

reads and executes the SConscript files as Python scripts,
so you may use normal Python scripting capabilities
(such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported Python libraries)
to handle complicated build situations.
<B>scons</B>,

however, reads and executes all of the SConscript files
<I>before</I>

it begins building any targets.
To make this obvious,
<B>scons</B>

prints the following messages about what it is doing:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons foo.out
scons: Reading SConscript files ...
scons: done reading SConscript files.
scons: Building targets  ...
cp foo.in foo.out
scons: done building targets.
$

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The status messages
(everything except the line that reads &quot;cp foo.in foo.out&quot;)
may be suppressed using the
<B>-Q</B>

option.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

does not automatically propagate
the external environment used to execute
<B>scons</B>

to the commands used to build target files.
This is so that builds will be guaranteed
repeatable regardless of the environment
variables set at the time
<B>scons</B>

is invoked.
This also means that if the compiler or other commands
that you want to use to build your target files
are not in standard system locations,
<B>scons</B>

will not find them unless
you explicitly set the PATH
to include those locations.
Whenever you create an
<B>scons</B>

construction environment,
you can propagate the value of PATH
from your external environment as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {'PATH' : os.environ['PATH']})

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<B>scons</B>

can scan known input files automatically for dependency
information (for example, #include statements
in C or C++ files) and will rebuild dependent files appropriately
whenever any &quot;included&quot; input file changes. 
<B>scons</B>

supports the
ability to define new scanners for unknown input file types.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

knows how to fetch files automatically from
SCCS or RCS subdirectories
using SCCS, RCS or BitKeeper.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

is normally executed in a top-level directory containing a
<I>SConstruct</I>

file, optionally specifying
as command-line arguments
the target file or files to be built.
<P>
By default, the command
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
will build all target files in or below the current directory.
Explicit default targets
(to be built when no targets are specified on the command line)
may be defined the SConscript file(s)
using the
<B>Default()</B>

function, described below.
<P>
Even when
<B>Default()</B>

targets are specified in the SConscript file(s),
all target files in or below the current directory
may be built by explicitly specifying
the current directory (.)
as a command-line target:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Building all target files,
including any files outside of the current directory,
may be specified by supplying a command-line target
of the root directory (on POSIX systems):
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons /

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets
should be built (on Windows systems):
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons C:\ D:\

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
To build only specific targets,
supply them as command-line arguments:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons foo bar

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
in which case only the specified targets will be built
(along with any derived files on which they depend).
<P>
Specifying &quot;cleanup&quot; targets in SConscript files is not
necessary.  The 
<B>-c</B>

flag removes all files
necessary to build the specified target:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons -c .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
to remove all target files, or:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons -c build export

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
to remove target files under build and export.
Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
Clean() function.
<P>
A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by
remaining at the top-level directory (where the 
<I>SConstruct</I>

file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to be
built:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons src/subdir

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
<B>-u</B>

option, which traverses up the directory
hierarchy until it finds the 
<I>SConstruct</I>

file, and then builds
targets relatively to the current subdirectory:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
cd src/subdir
scons -u .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<B>scons</B>

supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
<B>-j</B>

option that takes, as its argument, the number
of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons -j 4

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
builds four targets in parallel, for example.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can
be shared between multiple builds.  When caching is enabled in a
SConscript file, any target files built by 
<B>scons</B>

will be copied
to the cache.  If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it
will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally.
Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
<B>--cache-force</B>,

<B>--cache-disable</B>,

and
<B>--cache-show</B>

command-line options.  The
<B>--random</B>

option is useful to prevent multiple builds
from trying to update the cache simultaneously.
<P>
Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript file(s)
may be specified on the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons debug=1 .

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
These variables are available in SConscript files
through the ARGUMENTS dictionary,
and can be used in the SConscript file(s) to modify
the build in any way:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = '-g')
else:
    env = Environment()

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The command-line variable arguments are also available
in the ARGLIST list,
indexed by their order on the command line.
This allows you to process them in order rather than by name,
if necessary.
ARGLIST[0] returns a tuple
containing (argname, argvalue).
A Python exception is thrown if you
try to access a list member that
does not exist.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

requires Python version 1.5.2 or later.
There should be no other dependencies or requirements to run
<B>scons.</B>

<P>



By default,
<B>scons</B>

knows how to search for available programming tools
on various systems.
On WIN32 systems,
<B>scons</B>

searches in order for the
Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
the MinGW tool chain,
the Intel compiler tools,
and the PharLap ETS compiler.
On OS/2 systems,
<B>scons</B>

searches in order for the 
OS/2 compiler,
the GCC tool chain,
and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP-UX, and Sun Solaris systems,
<B>scons</B>

searches for the native compiler tools
(MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively)
and the GCC tool chain.
On all other platforms,
including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
<B>scons</B>

searches in order
for the GCC tool chain,
the Microsoft Visual C++ tools,
and the Intel compiler tools.
You may, of course, override these default values
by appropriate configuration of
Environment construction variables.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

In general, 
<B>scons </B>

supports the same command-line options as GNU
<B>make</B>,

and many of those supported by 
<B>cons</B>.

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-b<DD>
Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of
<B>make.</B>

<P>
<DT>-c, --clean, --remove<DD>
Clean up by removing all target files for which a construction
command is specified.
Also remove any files or directories associated to the construction command
using the Clean() function.
<P>
<DT>--cache-disable, --no-cache<DD>
Disable the derived-file caching specified by
<B>CacheDir</B>().

<B>scons</B>

will neither retrieve files from the cache
nor copy files to the cache.
<P>
<DT>--cache-force, --cache-populate<DD>
When using
<B>CacheDir</B>(),

populate a cache by copying any already-existing, up-to-date
derived files to the cache,
in addition to files built by this invocation.
This is useful to populate a new cache with
all the current derived files,
or to add to the cache any derived files
recently built with caching disabled via the
<B>--cache-disable</B>

option.
<P>
<DT>--cache-show<DD>
When using
<B>CacheDir</B>()

and retrieving a derived file from the cache,
show the command
that would have been executed to build the file,
instead of the usual report,
&quot;Retrieved `file' from cache.&quot;
This will produce consistent output for build logs,
regardless of whether a target
file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache.
<P>
<DT>-C<I> directory</I>,  --directory=<I>directory</I>

<DD>
Change to the specified 
<I>directory</I>

before searching for the 
<I>SConstruct</I>,

<I>Sconstruct</I>,

or
<I>sconstruct</I>

file, or doing anything
else.  Multiple 
<B>-C</B>

options are interpreted
relative to the previous one, and the right-most
<B>-C</B>

option wins. (This option is nearly
equivalent to 
<B>-f directory/SConstruct</B>,

except that it will search for
<I>SConstruct</I>,

<I>Sconstruct</I>,

or
<I>sconstruct</I>

in the specified directory.)
<P>





<P>
<DT>-D<DD>
Works exactly the same way as the
<B>-u</B>

option except for the way default targets are handled.
When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line,
all default targets are built, whether or not they are below the current
directory.
<P>
<DT>--debug=<I>type</I>

<DD>
Debug the build process.
<I>type</I>

specifies what type of debugging:
<P>
<DT>--debug=count<DD>
Print a count of how many objects are created
of the various classes used internally by SCons.
This only works when run under Python 2.1 or later.
<P>
<DT>--debug=dtree<DD>
Print the dependency tree
after each top-level target is built. This prints out only derived files.
<P>
<DT>--debug=includes<DD>
Print the include tree after each top-level target is built. 
This is generally used to find out what files are included by the sources
of a given derived file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons --debug=includes foo.o

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>--debug=memory<DD>
Prints how much memory SCons uses
before and after reading the SConscript files
and before and after building.
<P>
<DT>--debug=objects<DD>
Prints a list of the various objects
of the various classes used internally by SCons.
This only works when run under Python 2.1 or later.
<P>
<DT>--debug=pdb<DD>
Re-run SCons under the control of the
pdb

Python debugger.




<P>
<DT>--debug=presub<DD>
Print the raw command line used to build each target
before the construction environment variables are substituted.
Also shows which targets are being built by this command.
Output looks something like this:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons --debug=presub
Building myprog.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>--debug=time<DD>
Prints various time profiling information: the time spent
executing each build command, the total build time, the total time spent
executing build commands, the total time spent executing SConstruct and
SConscript files, and the total time spent executing SCons itself.
<P>
<DT>--debug=tree<DD>
Print the dependency tree
after each top-level target is built. This prints out the complete
dependency tree including implicit dependencies and ignored
dependencies.
<P>




<P>
<DT>-f<I> file</I>, --file=<I>file</I>, --makefile=<I>file</I>, --sconstruct=<I>file</I>

<DD>
Use 
<I>file </I>

as the initial SConscript file.
<P>
<DT>-h, --help<DD>
Print a local help message for this build, if one is defined in
the SConscript file(s), plus a line that describes the 
<B>-H</B>

option for command-line option help.  If no local help message
is defined, prints the standard help message about command-line
options.  Exits after displaying the appropriate message.
<P>
<DT>-H, --help-options<DD>
Print the standard help message about command-line options and
exit.
<P>
<DT>-i, --ignore-errors<DD>
Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.
<P>
<DT>-I<I> directory</I>, --include-dir=<I>directory</I>

<DD>
Specifies a 
<I>directory</I>

to search for
imported Python modules.  If several 
<B>-I</B>

options
are used, the directories are searched in the order specified.
<P>
<DT>--implicit-cache<DD>
Cache implicit dependencies. This can cause 
<B>scons</B>

to miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases where a new implicit
dependency is added earlier in the implicit dependency search path
(e.g. CPPPATH) than a current implicit dependency with the same name.
<P>
<DT>--implicit-deps-changed<DD>
Force SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This causes the
implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached. This implies
<B>--implicit-cache</B>.

<P>
<DT>--implicit-deps-unchanged<DD>
Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies.
This causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used.
This implies 
<B>--implicit-cache</B>.

<P>
<DT>-j<I> N</I>, --jobs=<I>N</I>

<DD>
Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously.
If there is more than one 
<B>-j </B>

option, the last one is effective.







<P>
<DT>-k, --keep-going<DD>
Continue as much as possible after an error.  The target that
failed and those that depend on it will not be remade, but other
targets specified on the command line will still be processed.
<P>







<P>
<DT>--duplicate=<I>ORDER</I>

<DD>
There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard links,
soft (symbolic) links and copies. The default behaviour of SCons is to 
prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You can specify different
behaviours with this option.
<I>ORDER</I>

must be one of 
<I>hard-soft-copy</I>

(the default),
<I>soft-hard-copy</I>,

<I>hard-copy</I>,

<I>soft-copy</I>

or
<I>copy</I>.

SCons will attempt to duplicate files using
the mechanisms in the specified order.
<P>





















<P>
<DT>-m<DD>
Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of
<B>make</B>.

<P>
<DT>--max-drift=<I>SECONDS</I>

<DD>
Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files to 
<I>SECONDS</I>.

This value determines how old a file must be before its content signature
is cached. The default value is 2 days, which means a file must have a
modification time of at least two days ago in order to have its content
signature cached. A negative value means to never cache the content
signature and to ignore the cached value if there already is one. A value
of 0 means to always cache the signature, no matter how old the file is.
<P>
<DT>-n, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon<DD>
No execute.  Print the commands that would be executed to build
any out-of-date target files, but do not execute the commands.
<P>





























<P>
<DT>--profile=<I>file</I>

<DD>
Run SCons under the Python profiler
and save the results in the specified
<I>file</I>.

The results may be analyzed using the Python
pstats module.
<DT>-q, --question<DD>
Do not run any commands, or print anything.  Just return an exit
status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to
date, non-zero otherwise.
<DT>-Q<DD>
Quiets SCons status messages about
reading SConscript files,
building targets
and entering directories.
Commands that are executed
to rebuild target files are still printed.
<P>




<P>
<DT>--random<DD>
Build dependencies in a random order.  This is useful when
building multiple trees simultaneously with caching enabled,
to prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build
or retrieve the same target files.
<P>
<DT>-s, --silent, --quiet<DD>
Silent.  Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild
target files.
Also suppresses SCons status messages.
<P>
<DT>-S, --no-keep-going, --stop<DD>
Ignored for compatibility with GNU 
<B>make</B>.

<P>
<DT>-t, --touch<DD>
Ignored for compatibility with GNU
<B>make</B>.

(Touching a file to make it
appear up-to-date is unnecessary when using 
<B>scons</B>.)

<P>
<DT>-u, --up, --search-up<DD>
Walks up the directory structure until an 
<I>SConstruct ,</I>

<I>Sconstruct</I>

or 
<I>sconstruct</I>

file is found, and uses that
as the top of the directory tree.
If no targets are specified on the command line,
only targets at or below the
current directory will be built.
<P>
<DT>-U<DD>
Works exactly the same way as the
<B>-u</B>

option except for the way default targets are handled.
When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line,
all default targets that are defined in the SConscript(s) in the current
directory are built, regardless of what directory the resultant targets end
up in.
<P>
<DT>-v, --version<DD>
Print the 
<B>scons</B>

version, copyright information,
list of authors, and any other relevant information.
Then exit.
<P>
<DT>-w, --print-directory<DD>
Print a message containing the working directory before and
after other processing.
<P>
<DT>--warn=<I>type</I>, --warn=no-<I>type</I>

<DD>
Enable or disable warnings.
<I>type</I>

specifies the type of warnings to be enabled or disabled:
<P>
<DT>--warn=all, --warn=no-all<DD>
Enables or disables all warnings.
<P>
<DT>--warn=dependency, --warn=no-dependency<DD>
Enables or disables warnings about dependencies.
These warnings are disabled by default.
<P>
<DT>--warn=deprecated, --warn=no-deprecated<DD>
Enables or disables warnings about use of deprecated features.
These warnings are enabled by default.
<P>
<DT>--warn=missing-sconscript, --warn=no-missing-sconscript<DD>
Enables or disables warnings about missing SConscript files.
These warnings are enabled by default.
<P>
<DT>--no-print-directory<DD>
Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.
<P>





















<P>
<DT>-Y<I> repository</I>, --repository=<I>repository</I>

<DD>
Search the specified repository for any input and target
files not found in the local directory hierarchy.  Multiple
<B>-Y</B>

options may specified, in which case the
repositories are searched in the order specified.
<P>

<H2>CONFIGURATION FILE REFERENCE</H2>



<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Construction Environments</H3>

A construction environment is the basic means by which the SConscript
files communicate build information to 
<B>scons</B>.

A new construction environment is created using the 
<B>Environment </B>

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
By default, a new construction environment is
initialized with a set of builder methods
and construction variables that are appropriate
for the current platform.
An optional platform keyword argument may be
used to specify that an environment should
be initialized for a different platform:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(platform = 'cygwin')
env = Environment(platform = 'os2')
env = Environment(platform = 'posix')
env = Environment(platform = 'win32')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate
construction variables in the environment
to use and generate file names with prefixes
and suffixes appropriate for the platform.
<P>
Note that the
<B>win32</B>

platform adds the
<B>SYSTEMROOT</B>

variable from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
<B>ENV</B>

dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
(such as fetching source files from
external CVS repository specifications like 
<B>:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net">anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net</A>:/cvsroot/scons</B>)

will work on Win32 systems.
<P>
The platform argument may be function or callable object,
in which case the Environment() method
will call the specified argument to update
the new construction environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_platform(env):
    env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(platform = my_platform)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Additionally, a specific set of tools
with which to initialize the environment
may specified as an optional keyword argument:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(tools = ['msvc', 'lex'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Non-built-in tools may be specified using the toolpath argument:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(tools = ['default', 'foo'], toolpath = ['tools'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
This looks for a tool specification in tools/foo.py (as well as
using the ordinary default tools for the platform).  foo.py should
have two functions: generate(env) and exists(env).  generate()
modifies the passed in environment and exists() should return a true
value if the tool is available.  Tools in the toolpath are used before
any of the built-in ones.  For example, adding gcc.py to the toolpath
would override the built-in gcc tool.
<P>
The elements of the tools list may also
be functions or callable objects,
in which case the Environment() method
will call the specified elements
to update the new construction environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def my_tool(env):
    env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

env = Environment(tools = [my_tool])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The tool definition (i.e. my_tool()) can use the PLATFORM variable from
the environment it receives to customize the tool for different platforms.
<P>
If no tool list is specified, then SCons will auto-detect the installed
tools using the PATH variable in the ENV construction variable and the
platform name when the Environment is constructed. Changing the PATH
variable after the Environment is constructed will not cause the tools to
be redetected.
<P>
SCons supports the following tool specifications out of the box:

<P>
Additionally, there is a &quot;tool&quot; named
<B>default</B>

which configures the
environment with a default set of tools for the current platform.
<P>
On posix and cygwin platforms
the GNU tools (e.g. gcc) are preferred by SCons,
on win32 the Microsoft tools (e.g. msvc)
followed by MinGW are preferred by SCons,
and in OS/2 the IBM tools (e.g. icc) are preferred by SCons.

<H3>Builder Methods</H3>

<P>
Build rules are specified by calling a construction
environment's builder methods.
The arguments to the builder methods are
<B>target</B>

(a list of target files)
and
<B>source</B>

(a list of source files).
<P>
Because long lists of file names
can lead to a lot of quoting,
<B>scons</B>

supplies a
<B>Split()</B>

global function
and a same-named environment method
that split a single string
into a list, separated on
strings of white-space characters.
(These are similar to the
string.split() method
from the standard Python library,
but work even if the input isn't a string.)
<P>
Like all Python arguments,
the target and source arguments to a builder method
can be specified either with or without
the &quot;target&quot; and &quot;source&quot; keywords.
When the keywords are omitted,
the target is first,
followed by the source.
The following are equivalent examples of calling the Program builder method:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(source =  ['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target = 'bar')
env.Program(target = 'bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program(target = 'bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
env.Program('bar', source = string.split('bar.c foo.c'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
When the target shares the same base name
as the source and only the suffix varies,
and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type,
then the target argument may be omitted completely,
and
<B>scons</B>

will deduce the target file name from
the source file name.
The following examples all build the
executable program
<B>bar</B>

(on POSIX systems)
or 
<B>bar.exe</B>

(on Windows systems)
from the bar.c source file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.c')
env.Program('bar', source = 'bar.c')
env.Program(source = 'bar.c')
env.Program('bar.c')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
It is possible to override or add construction variables when calling a
builder method by passing additional keyword arguments.
These overridden or added
variables will only be in effect when building the target, so they will not
affect other parts of the build. For example, if you want to add additional
libraries for just one program:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or generate a shared library with a nonstandard suffix:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp', SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Although the builder methods defined by
<B>scons</B>

are, in fact,
methods of a construction environment object,
they may also be called without an explicit environment:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Program('hello', 'hello.c')
SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
In this case,
the methods are called internally using a default construction
environment that consists of the tools and values that
<B>scons</B>

has determined are appropriate for the local system.
<P>
All builder methods return a list of Nodes
that represent the target or targets that will be built.
A
<I>Node</I>

is an internal SCons object
which represents
build targets or sources.
<P>
The returned Node(s)
can be passed to other builder methods as source(s)
or passed to any SCons function or method
where a filename would normally be accepted.
For example, if it were necessary
to add a specific
<B>-D</B>

flag when compiling one specific object file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CCFLAGS='-DBAR')
env.Program(source = ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Using a Node in this way
makes for a more portable build
by avoiding having to specify
a platform-specific object suffix
when calling the Program() builder method.
<P>
Note that Builder calls will automatically &quot;flatten&quot;
the source and target file lists,
so it's all right to have the bar_obj list
return by the StaticObject() call
in the middle of the source file list.
If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by Builders
directly using Python,
you can either build the list by hand:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
for object in objects:
    print str(object)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Or you can use the
<B>Flatten</B>()

supplied by scons
to create a list containing just the Nodes,
which may be more convenient:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')
objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
for object in objects:
    print str(object)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The path name for a Node's file may be used
by passing the Node to the Python-builtin
<B>str()</B>

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CCFLAGS='-DBAR')
print &quot;The path to bar_obj is:&quot;, str(bar_obj_list[0])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Note again that because the Builder call returns a list,
we have to access the first element in the list
<B>(bar_obj_list[0])</B>

to get at the Node that actually represents
the object file.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

provides the following builder methods:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>CFile()<DD>
<DT>env.CFile()<DD>
Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file.
The suffix specified by the $CFILESUFFIX construction variable
(.c by default)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present. Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds foo.c
env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
# builds bar.c
env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>CXXFile()<DD>
<DT>env.CXXFile()<DD>
Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy)
input file.
The suffix specified by the $CXXFILESUFFIX construction variable
(.cc by default)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present. Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds foo.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
# builds bar.cc
env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>DVI()<DD>
<DT>env.DVI()<DD>
Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file.
If the source file suffix is .tex,
<B>scons</B>

will examine the contents of the file;
if the string
<B>\documentclass</B>

or
<B>\documentstyle</B>

is found, the file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and
the target is built by invoking the $LATEXCOM command line;
otherwise, the $TEXCOM command line is used.
If the file is a LaTeX file,
the
<B>DVI</B>

builder method will also examine the contents
of the
<B>.aux file</B>

and invoke the $BIBTEX command line
if the string
<B>bibdata</B>

is found,
and will examine the contents
<B>.log</B>

file and re-run the $LATEXCOM command
if the log file says it is necessary.
<P>
The suffix .dvi
(hard-coded within TeX itself)
is automatically added to the target
if it is not already present. Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds from aaa.tex
env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.dvi
env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
# builds from ccc.latex
env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Jar()<DD>
<DT>env.Jar()<DD>
Builds a Java archive (.jar) file
from a source tree of .class files.
If the $JARCHDIR value is set, the
<B>jar</B>

command will change to the specified directory using the
<B>-C</B>

option.
If the contents any of the source files begin with the string
<B>Manifest-Version</B>,

the file is assumed to be a manifest
and is passed to the
<B>jar</B>

command with the
<B>m</B>

option set.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Java()<DD>
<DT>env.Java()<DD>
Builds one or more Java class files
from one or more source trees of .java files.
The class files will be placed underneath
the specified target directory.
SCons will parse each source .java file
to find the classes
(including inner classes)
defined within that file,
and from that figure out the
target .class files that will be created.
SCons will also search each Java file
for the Java package name,
which it assumes can be found on a line
beginning with the string
<B>package</B>

in the first column;
the resulting .class files
will be placed in a directory reflecting
the specified package name.
For example,
the file
<I>Foo.java</I>

defining a single public
<I>Foo</I>

class and
containing a package name of
<I>sub.dir</I>

will generate a corresponding
<I>sub/dir/Foo.class</I>

class file.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>JavaH()<DD>
<DT>env.JavaH()<DD>
Builds C header and source files for
implementing Java native methods.
The target can be either a directory
in which the header files will be written,
or a header file name which
will contain all of the definitions.
The source can be either the names of .class files,
or the objects returned from the
<B>Java</B>

builder method.
<P>
If the construction variable
<B>JAVACLASSDIR</B>

is set, either in the environment
or in the call to the
<B>JavaH</B>

builder method itself,
then the value of the variable
will be stripped from the
beginning of any .class file names.
<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds java_native.h
classes = env.Java(target = 'classdir', source = 'src')
env.JavaH(target = 'java_native.h', source = classes)

# builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'include',
          source = ['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'])

# builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
env.JavaH(target = 'export',
          source = ['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
          JAVACLASSDIR = 'classes')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Library()<DD>
<DT>env.Library()<DD>
A synonym for the
<B>StaticLibrary</B>

builder method.
<P>

<DT>M4()<DD>
<DT>env.M4()<DD>
Builds an output file from an M4 input file.
This uses a default $M4FLAGS value of
<B>-E</B>,

which considers all warnings to be fatal
and stops on the first warning
when using the GNU version of m4.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Moc()<DD>
<DT>env.Moc()<DD>
Builds an output file from a moc input file. Moc input files are either 
header files or cxx files. This builder is only available after using the 
tool 'qt'. See the QTDIR variable for more information.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Moc('foo.h') # generates moc_foo.cc
env.Moc('foo.cpp') # generates foo.moc

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>MSVSProject()<DD>
<DT>env.MSVSProject()<DD>
Builds Microsoft Visual Studio project files.
This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version of
Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed version,
or the version set by 
<B>MSVS_VERSION</B>

in the Environment constructor).
For VS 6, it will generate 
<B>.dsp</B>

and
<B>.dsw</B>

files, for VS 7, it will
generate
<B>.vcproj</B>

and
<B>.sln</B>

files.
<P>
It takes several lists of filenames to be placed into the project
file, currently these are limited to 
<B>srcs, incs, localincs, resources,</B>

and
<B>misc.</B>

These are pretty self explanatory, but it
should be noted that the 'srcs' list is NOT added to the $SOURCES
environment variable.  This is because it represents a list of files
to be added to the project file, not the source used to build the
project file (in this case, the 'source' is the SConscript file used
to call MSVSProject).
<P>
In addition to these values (which are all optional, although not
specifying any of them results in an empty project file), the
following values must be specified:
<P>
target: The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file.  The correct
suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the value
<P>
env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX']
<P>
will be defined to the correct value (see example below).
<P>
variant: The name of this particular variant.  These are typically
things like &quot;Debug&quot; or &quot;Release&quot;, but really can be anything you want.
Multiple calls to MSVSProject with different variants are allowed: all
variants will be added to the project file with their appropriate
build targets and sources.
<P>
buildtarget: A list of SCons.Node.FS objects which is returned from
the command which builds the target.  This is used to tell SCons what
to build when the 'build' button is pressed inside of the IDE.
<P>
Example Usage:

<DT>Object()<DD>
<DT>env.Object()<DD>
A synonym for the
<B>StaticObject</B>

builder method.
<P>

<DT>PCH()<DD>
<DT>env.PCH()<DD>
Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header.
Calling this builder method
returns a list of two targets: the PCH as the first element, and the object
file as the second element. Normally the object file is ignored.
This builder method is only
provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the compiler. 
The PCH builder method is generally used in
conjuction with the PCH construction variable to force object files to use
the precompiled header:

</DL>


<P>

<DT>PDF()<DD>
<DT>env.PDF()<DD>
Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file
(or, by extension, a .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file).
The suffix specified by the $PDFSUFFIX construction variable
(.pdf by default)
is added automatically to the target
if it is not already present.  Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds from aaa.tex
env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>PostScript()<DD>
<DT>env.PostScript()<DD>
Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file
(or, by extension, a .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file).
The suffix specified by the $PSSUFFIX construction variable
(.ps by default)
is added automatically to the target
if it is not already present.  Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
# builds from aaa.tex
env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
# builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Program()<DD>
<DT>env.Program()<DD>
Builds an executable given one or more object files
or C, C++, D, or Fortran source files.
If any C, C++, D or Fortran source files are specified,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files using the
<B>Object</B>

builder method;
see that builder method's description for
a list of legal source file suffixes
and how they are interpreted.
The target executable file prefix
(specified by the $PROGPREFIX construction variable; nothing by default)
and suffix
(specified by the $PROGSUFFIX construction variable;
by default, .exe on Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Program(target = 'foo', source = ['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>RES()<DD>
<DT>env.RES()<DD>
Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file.
This builder method is only provided
when Microsoft Visual C++ or MinGW is being used as the compiler. The
<I>.res</I>

(or 
<I>.o </I>

for MinGW) suffix is added to the target name if no other suffix is given. The source
file is scanned for implicit dependencies as though it were a C file. Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.RES('resource.rc')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>RMIC()<DD>
<DT>env.RMIC()<DD>
Builds stub and skeleton class files
for remote objects
from Java .class files.
The target is a directory
relative to which the stub
and skeleton class files will be written.
The source can be the names of .class files,
or the objects return from the
<B>Java</B>

builder method.
<P>
If the construction variable
<B>JAVACLASSDIR</B>

is set, either in the environment
or in the call to the
<B>RMIC</B>

builder method itself,
then the value of the variable
will be stripped from the
beginning of any .class file names.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<P>

<DT>SharedLibrary()<DD>
<DT>env.SharedLibrary()<DD>
Builds a shared library
(.so on a POSIX system, .dll on WIN32)
given one or more object files
or C, C++, D or Fortran source files.
If any source files are given,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files.
The static library prefix and suffix (if any)
are automatically added to the target.
The target library file prefix
(specified by the $SHLIBPREFIX construction variable;
by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems)
and suffix
(specified by the $SHLIBSUFFIX construction variable;
by default, .dll on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar', source = ['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
On WIN32 systems, the
<B>SharedLibrary</B>

builder method will always build an import (.lib) library
in addition to the shared (.dll) library,
adding a .lib library with the same basename
if there is not already a .lib file explicitly
listed in the targets.
<P>
Any object files listed in the
<B>source</B>

must have been built for a shared library
(that is, using the
<B>SharedObject</B>

builder method).
<B>scons</B>

will raise an error if there is any mismatch.
<DT><DD>
On WIN32 systems, specifying &quot;register=1&quot; will cause the dll to be
registered after it is built using REGSVR32.  The command that is run
(&quot;regsvr32&quot; by default) is determined by $REGSVR construction
variable, and the flags passed are determined by $REGSVRFLAGS.  By
default, $REGSVRFLAGS includes &quot;/s&quot;, to prevent dialogs from popping
up and requiring user attention when it is run.  If you change
$REGSVRFLAGS, be sure to include &quot;/s&quot;.  For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SharedLibrary(target = 'bar',
                  source = ['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'],
                  register=1)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
will register &quot;bar.dll&quot; as a COM object when it is done linking it.
<P>

<DT>SharedObject()<DD>
<DT>env.SharedObject()<DD>
Builds an object file for
inclusion in a shared library.
Source files must have one of the same set of extensions
specified above for the
<B>StaticObject</B>

builder method.
On some platforms building a shared object requires additional
compiler options (e.g. -fPIC for gcc) in addition to those needed to build a
normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no difference between a
shared object and a normal (static) one. When there is a difference, SCons
will only allow shared objects to be linked into a shared library, and will
use a different suffix for shared objects. On platforms where there is no
difference, SCons will allow both normal (static)
and shared objects to be linked into a
shared library, and will use the same suffix for shared and normal
(static) objects.
The target object file prefix
(specified by the $SHOBJPREFIX construction variable;
by default, the same as $OBJPREFIX)
and suffix
(specified by the $SHOBJSUFFIX construction variable)
are automatically added to the target if not already present. 
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SharedObject(target = 'ddd', source = 'ddd.c')
env.SharedObject(target = 'eee.o', source = 'eee.cpp')
env.SharedObject(target = 'fff.obj', source = 'fff.for')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>StaticLibrary()<DD>
<DT>env.StaticLibrary()<DD>
Builds a static library given one or more object files
or C, C++, D or Fortran source files.
If any source files are given,
then they will be automatically
compiled to object files.
The static library prefix and suffix (if any)
are automatically added to the target.
The target library file prefix
(specified by the $LIBPREFIX construction variable;
by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems)
and suffix
(specified by the $LIBSUFFIX construction variable;
by default, .lib on Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Example:

<P>

<DT>StaticObject()<DD>
<DT>env.StaticObject()<DD>

The target object file prefix
(specified by the $OBJPREFIX construction variable; nothing by default)
and suffix
(specified by the $OBJSUFFIX construction variable;
.obj on Windows systems, .o on POSIX systems)
are automatically added to the target if not already present.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.StaticObject(target = 'aaa', source = 'aaa.c')

<DT>Tar()<DD>
<DT>env.Tar()<DD>
Builds a tar archive of the specified files
and/or directories.
Unlike most builder methods,
the
<B>Tar</B>

builder method may be called multiple times
for a given target;
each additional call
adds to the list of entries
that will be built into the archive.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

# Create the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add &quot;another&quot; to the stuff.tar file.
env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

# Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

# Also set the suffix to .tgz.

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>TypeLibrary()<DD>
<DT>env.TypeLibrary()<DD>
Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from and input IDL file
(.idl).  In addition, it will build the associated inteface stub and
proxy source files.  It names them according to the base name of the .idl file.
<DT><DD>
For example,
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.TypeLibrary(source=&quot;foo.idl&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c, and foo_data.c.
<P>

<DT>Uic()<DD>
<DT>env.Uic()<DD>
Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from an ui file.
and returns the corresponding nodes in the above order.
This builder is only available after using the tool 'qt'. Note: you can 
specify .ui files directly as inputs for Program, Library and SharedLibrary
without using this builder. Using the builder lets you override the standard
naming conventions (be careful: prefixes are always prepended to names of
built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may set them to ``).
See the QTDIR variable for more information.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Uic('foo.ui') # -&gt; ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
env.Uic(target = Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>Zip()<DD>
<DT>env.Zip()<DD>
Builds a zip archive of the specified files
and/or directories.
Unlike most builder methods,
the
<B>Zip</B>

builder method may be called multiple times
for a given target;
each additional call
adds to the list of entries
that will be built into the archive.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

# Create the stuff.zip file.
env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
# Also add &quot;another&quot; to the stuff.tar file.
env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

<P>
<B>scons</B>

automatically scans
C source files, C++ source files,
Fortran source files with

file extensions,
and assembly language files with
<B>.S</B>

(POSIX systems only),
<B>.spp,</B>

or
<B>.SPP</B>

files extensions
for C preprocessor dependencies,
so the dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly.
In addition, all
targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources.
An explicit dependency can
be specified using the 
<B>Depends </B>

<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Methods and Functions to Do Things</H3>

In addition to Builder methods,
<B>scons</B>

provides a number of other construction environment methods
and global functions to
manipulate the build configuration.
<P>
Usually, a construction environment method
and global function with the same name both exist
so that you don't have to remember whether
to a specific bit of functionality
must be called with or without a construction environment.
In the following list,
if you call something as a global function
it looks like:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Function(<I>arguments</I>)

</PRE>

</DL>


and if you call something through a construction
environment it looks like:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Function(<I>arguments</I>)

</PRE>

</DL>


If you can call the functionality in both ways,
then both forms are listed.
<P>
Except where otherwise noted,
the same-named
construction environment method
and global function 
provide the exact same functionality.
The only difference is that,
where appropriate,
calling the functionality through a construction environment will
substitute construction variables into
any supplied strings.
For example:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(FOO = 'foo')
Default('$FOO')
env.Default('$FOO')

</PRE>

</DL>


the first call to the global
<B>Default()</B>

function will actually add a target named
<B>$FOO</B>

to the list of default targets,
while the second call to the
<B>env.Default()</B>

construction environment method
will expand the value
and add a target named
<B>foo</B>

to the list of default targets.
For more on construction variable expansion,
see the next section on
construction variables.
<P>
Construction environment methods
and global functions supported by
<B>scons</B>

<P>

<DT>AddPostAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DT>env.AddPostAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
Arranges for the specified

after the specified
<I>target</I>

has been built.
The specified action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that
can be converted into an Action object

<P>

<DT>AddPreAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.AddPreAction(<I>target</I>, <I>action</I>)

<DD>
Arranges for the specified

is built.
The specified action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that

<P>

<DT>Alias(<I>alias</I>, [<I>targets</I>])

<DD>
<DT>env.Alias(<I>alias</I>, [<I>targets</I>])

<DD>
Creates one or more phony targets that
expand to one or more other targets.
Returns the Node object representing the alias,
which exists outside of any file system.
This Node object, or the alias name,
may be used as a dependency of any other target,
including another alias.
<B>Alias</B>

<P>

<DT>AlwaysBuild(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
<DT>env.AlwaysBuild(<I>target</I>, ...)

<DD>
Marks each given
<I>target</I>

so that it is always assumed to be out of date,
and will always be rebuilt if needed.
Note, however, that
<B>AlwaysBuild</B>()

does not add its target(s) to the default target list,
so the targets will only be built
if they are specified on the command line,
or are a dependent of a target specified on the command line--but
they will
<I>always</I>

be built if so specified.
Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
<B>AlwaysBuild</B>().

<P>

<DT>env.Append(<I>key</I>=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the end of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the values of the construction variable
and the keyword argument are the same type,
then the two values will be simply added together.
Otherwise, the construction variable
and the value of the keyword argument
are both coerced to lists,
and the lists are added together.
(See also the Prepend method, below.)
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Append(CCFLAGS = ' -g', FOO = ['foo.yyy'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>env.AppendENVPath(<I>name</I>, <I>newpath</I>, [<I>envname</I>, <I>sep</I>])

<DD>
This appends new path elements to the given path in the
specified external environment
(<B>ENV</B>

by default).
This will only add
any particular path once (leaving the last one it encounters and
ignoring the rest, to preserve path order),
and to help assure this,
will normalize all paths (using
<B>os.path.normpath</B>

and
<B>os.path.normcase</B>).

This can also handle the
case where the given old path variable is a list instead of a
string, in which case a list will be returned instead of a string.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

yields:
before: /foo:/biz
after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>env.AppendUnique(<I>key</I>=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the end of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the construction variable being appended to is a list,
then any value(s) that already exist in the
construction variable will
<I>not</I>

be added again to the list.

<DT>env.BitKeeper()<DD>
A factory function that

to be used to fetch source files
using BitKeeper.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the

function.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT>BuildDir(<I>build_dir</I>, <I>src_dir</I>, [<I>duplicate</I>])

<DD>
<DT>env.BuildDir(<I>build_dir</I>, <I>src_dir</I>, [<I>duplicate</I>])

<DD>
This specifies a build directory
<I>build_dir</I>

in which to build all derived files
that would normally be built under
<I>src_dir</I>.

Multiple build directories can be set up for multiple build variants, for
example. 
<I>src_dir</I>

must be underneath the SConstruct file's directory,
and
<I>build_dir</I>

may not be underneath the
<I>src_dir .</I>

<P>
The default behavior is for
<B>scons</B>

to duplicate all of the files in the tree underneath
<I>src_dir</I>

into
<I>build_dir</I>,

and then build the derived files within the copied tree.
(The duplication is performed by
linking or copying,
depending on the platform; see also the
<I>--duplicate</I>

option.)
This guarantees correct builds
regardless of whether intermediate source files
are generated during the build,
where preprocessors or other scanners search
for included files,
or whether individual compilers or other invoked tools
are hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files.
<P>
This behavior of making a complete copy of the source tree
may be disabled by setting
<I>duplicate</I>

to 0.
This will cause
<B>scons</B>

to invoke Builders using the
path names of source files in
<I>src_dir</I>

and the path names of derived files within
<I>build_dir</I>.

This is always more efficient than
<I>duplicate</I>=1,

and is usually safe for most builds.
Specifying
<I>duplicate</I>=0,

however,
may cause build problems
if source files are generated during the build,
if any invoked tools are hard-coded to
put derived files in the same directory as the source files.
<P>
Note that specifying a
<B>BuildDir</B>

works most naturally
with a subsidiary SConscript file
in the source directory.
However,
you would then call the subsidiary SConscript file
not in the source directory,
but in the
<I>build_dir ,</I>

as if
<B>scons</B>

had made a virtual copy of the source tree
regardless of the value of 
<I>duplicate</I>.

This is how you tell
<B>scons</B>

which variant of a source tree to build.
For example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
BuildDir('build-variant1', 'src')
SConscript('build-variant1/SConscript')
BuildDir('build-variant2', 'src')
SConscript('build-variant2/SConscript')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
See also the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function, described below,
for another way to 
specify a build directory
in conjunction with calling a subsidiary
SConscript file.)
<P>

<DT>Builder(<I>action</I>, [<I>arguments</I>])

<DD>
<DT>env.Builder(<I>action</I>, [<I>arguments</I>])

<DD>
Creates a Builder object for
the specified
<I>action</I>.

See the section &quot;Builder Objects,&quot;
below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.
<P>

<DT>CacheDir(<I>cache_dir</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.CacheDir(<I>cache_dir</I>)

<DD>
Specifies that
<B>scons</B>

will maintain a cache of derived files in
<I>cache_dir .</I>

The derived files in the cache will be shared
among all the builds using the same
<B>CacheDir</B>()

call.
<P>
When a
<B>CacheDir</B>()

is being used and
<B>scons</B>

finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt,
it will first look in the cache to see if a
derived file has already been built
from identical input files and an identical build action
(as incorporated into the MD5 build signature).
If so,
<B>scons</B>

will retrieve the file from the cache.
If the derived file is not present in the cache,
<B>scons</B>

will rebuild it and
then place a copy of the built file in the cache
(identified by its MD5 build signature),
so that it may be retrieved by other
builds that need to build the same derived file
from identical inputs.
<P>
Use of a specified
<B>CacheDir()</B>

may be disabled for any invocation
by using the
<B>--cache-disable</B>

option.
<P>
If the
<B>--cache-force</B>

option is used,
<B>scons</B>

will place a copy of
<I>all</I>

derived files in the cache,
even if they already existed
and were not built by this invocation.
This is useful to populate a cache
the first time
<B>CacheDir</B>()

is added to a build,
or after using the
<B>--cache-disable</B>

option.
<P>
When using
<B>CacheDir</B>(),

<B>scons</B>

will report,
&quot;Retrieved `file' from cache,&quot;
unless the
<B>--cache-show</B>

option is being used.
When the
<B>--cache-show</B>

option is used,
<B>scons</B>

will print the action that
<I>would</I>

have been used to build the file,
without any indication that
the file was actually retrieved from the cache.
This is useful to generate build logs
that are equivalent regardless of whether
a given derived file has been built in-place
or retrieved from the cache.
<P>

<DT>Clean(<I>targets</I>, <I>files_or_dirs</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Clean(<I>targets</I>, <I>files_or_dirs</I>)

<DD>
This specifies a list of files or directories which should be removed
whenever the targets are specified with the
<B>-c</B>

command line option.
The specified targets may be a list
or an individual target.
Multiple calls to
<B>Clean</B>()

are legal,
and create new targets or add files and directories to the
clean list for the specified targets.
<P>
Multiple files or directories should be specified
either as separate arguments to the
<B>Clean</B>()

method, or as a list.
<B>Clean</B>()

will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment
Builder methods.
Examples:
<P>

<DD>
<DT>env.Command(<I>target</I>, <I>source</I>, <I>commands</I>, [<I>key</I>=<I>val</I>, ...])

<DD>
Executes a specific action
(or list of actions)
to build a target file or files.
This is more convenient
than defining a separate Builder object
for a single special-case build.
Any keyword arguments specified override any
same-named existing construction variables.
<P>
Note that an action can be an external command,
specified as a string,
or a callable Python object;
see &quot;Action Objects,&quot; below.

The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>

<P>
The optional specified

<DT>Default(<I>targets</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Default(<I>targets</I>)

<DD>
This specifies a list of default targets,
which will be built by
<B>scons</B>

if no explicit targets are given on the command line.
Multiple calls to
<B>Default</B>()

are legal,
and add to the list of default targets.
<P>
Multiple targets should be specified as
separate arguments to the
<B>Default</B>()

</DL>


<DT><DD>
An argument to
<B>Default</B>()

of
<B>None</B>

will clear all default targets.
Later calls to
<B>Default</B>()

will add to the (now empty) default-target list
like normal.
<P>
The current list of targets added using the
<B>Default</B>()

function or method is available in the
<B>DEFAULT_TARGETS</B>

list;

<P>

<DT>DefaultEnvironment([<I>args</I>])

<DD>
Creates and returns a default construction environment object.
This construction environment is used internally by SCons

from source code management systems.
<P>

<DT>Depends(<I>target</I>, <I>dependency</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Depends(<I>target</I>, <I>dependency</I>)

<DT>Dir(<I>name</I>, [<I>directory</I>])

<DD>
<DT>env.Dir(<I>name</I>, [<I>directory</I>])

<DD>
This returns a Directory Node,
an object that represents the specified directory
<I>name</I>.

<I>name</I>

can be a relative or absolute path. 
<I>directory</I>

is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory. 
If no
<I>directory</I>

is specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.
<P>
Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you

<DD>
<DT>env.Execute(<I>action</I>, [<I>strfunction</I>, <I>varlist</I>])

<DD>
Executes an Action object.
The specified
<I>action</I>

may be an Action object
(see the section &quot;Action Objects,&quot;
below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior),
or it may be a command-line string,
list of commands,

The exit value of the command
or return value of the Python function
will be returned.
<P>

<DT>Exit([<I>value</I>])

<DD>
<DT>env.Exit([<I>value</I>])

<DD>
This tells

(zero)
is used if no value is specified.
<P>

<DT>Export(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Export(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
This tells 
<B>scons</B>

to export a list of variables from the current
SConscript file to all other SConscript files.
The exported variables are kept in a global collection,
so subsequent calls to
<B>Export</B>()

will over-write previous exports that have the same name. 
Multiple variable names can be passed to
<B>Export</B>()

as separate arguments or as a list. A dictionary can be used to map
variables to a different name when exported. Both local variables and
global variables can be exported.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
# Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
Export(&quot;env&quot;)

package = 'my_name'
# Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.

<I>name</I>

can be a relative or absolute path. 
<I>directory</I>

is an optional directory that will be used as the parent directory. 
<P>
File Nodes can be used anywhere you

<DT>env.Flatten(<I>sequence</I>)

<DD>
Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple)
that may contain nested sequences
and returns a flattened list containing
all of the individual elements in any sequence.
This can be helpful for collecting
the lists returned by calls to Builders;
other Builders will automatically
flatten lists specified as input,
but direct Python manipulation of
these lists does not:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
foo = Object('foo.c')
bar = Object('bar.c')

# Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
# `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

# Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
# the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
Program(source = objects)

# If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
# call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
for object in Flatten(objects):

<DT>Import(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Import(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
This tells

to import a list of variables into the current SConscript file. This
will import variables that were exported with
<B>Export</B>()

or in the 
<I>exports</I>

argument to 
<B>SConscript</B>().

Variables exported by 
<B>SConscript</B>()

have precedence.
Multiple variable names can be passed to

<DT>env.Perforce()<DD>
A factory function that

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', env.Perforce())

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Perforce uses a number of external
environment variables for its operation.
Consequently, this function adds the

to the construction environment's
ENV dictionary:
P4CHARSET,
P4CLIENT,
P4LANGUAGE,
P4PASSWD,
P4PORT,
P4USER,

<I>string</I>

to the environment through which the method was called.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.Platform('posix')

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that the
<B>win32</B>

platform adds the
<B>SYSTEMROOT</B>

variable from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
<B>ENV</B>

dictionary.
This is so that any executed commands
that use sockets to connect with other systems
(such as fetching source files from
external CVS repository specifications like 
<B>:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net">anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net</A>:/cvsroot/scons</B>)

will work on Win32 systems.

deletes a target before building it.
Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to
<B>Precious</B>().

<P>

<DT>env.Prepend(<I>key</I>=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the beginning of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the values of the construction variable
and the keyword argument are the same type,
then the two values will be simply added together.
Otherwise, the construction variable
and the value of the keyword argument
are both coerced to lists,
and the lists are added together.
(See also the Append method, above.)

</DL>


<P>

<DT>env.PrependENVPath(<I>name</I>, <I>newpath</I>, [<I>envname</I>, <I>sep</I>])

<DD>
This appends new path elements to the given path in the
specified external environment
(<B>ENV</B>

by default).
This will only add
any particular path once (leaving the first one it encounters and
ignoring the rest, to preserve path order),
and to help assure this,
will normalize all paths (using
<B>os.path.normpath</B>

and
<B>os.path.normcase</B>).

This can also handle the
case where the given old path variable is a list instead of a
string, in which case a list will be returned instead of a string.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
print 'before:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']
include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
print 'after:',env['ENV']['INCLUDE']

yields:
before: /biz:/foo
after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>env.AppendUnique(<I>key</I>=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DD>
Appends the specified keyword arguments
to the beginning of construction variables in the environment.
If the Environment does not have
the specified construction variable,
it is simply added to the environment.
If the construction variable being appended to is a list,
then any value(s) that already exist in the
construction variable will
<I>not</I>

be added again to the list.

<DT>env.RCS()<DD>
A factory function that

<B>SourceCode</B>

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', env.RCS())

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that
<B>scons</B>

will fetch source files
from RCS subdirectories automatically,
so configuring RCS
as demonstrated in the above example
should only be necessary if
you are fetching from
RCS,v
files in the same
directory as the source files,
or if you need to explicitly specify RCS
for a specific subdirectory.
<P>

<DT>env.Replace(<I>key</I>=<I>val</I>, [...])

<DT>Repository(<I>directory</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Repository(<I>directory</I>)

<DD>
Specifies that
<I>directory</I>

is a repository to be searched for files.
Multiple calls to
<B>Repository</B>()

are legal,
and each one adds to the list of
repositories that will be searched.
<P>
To
<B>scons</B>,

a repository is a copy of the source tree,
from the top-level directory on down,
which may contain
both source files and derived files
that can be used to build targets in
the local source tree.
The canonical example would be an
official source tree maintained by an integrator.
If the repository contains derived files,
then the derived files should have been built using
<B>scons</B>,

so that the repository contains the necessary
signature information to allow
<B>scons</B>

to figure out when it is appropriate to
use the repository copy of a derived file,
instead of building one locally.
<P>
Note that if an up-to-date derived file
already exists in a repository,
<B>scons</B>

will
<I>not</I>

make a copy in the local directory tree.
In order to guarantee that a local copy
will be made,
use the
<B>Local()</B>

method.
<P>

<DT>Return(<I>vars</I>)

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

what variable(s) to use as the return value(s) of the current SConscript
file. These variables will be returned to the &quot;calling&quot; SConscript file
as the return value(s) of 
<B>SConscript</B>().

Multiple variable names should be passed to 
<B>Return</B>()

as a list. Example:

<P>

<DT>env.SCCS()<DD>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
from SCCS.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
<B>SourceCode</B>

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', env.SCCS())

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
Note that

will fetch source files
from SCCS subdirectories automatically,
so configuring SCCS
as demonstrated in the above example
should only be necessary if
you are fetching from
<I>s.SCCS</I>

files in the same

<DT>env.SConscript(dirs=<I>subdirs</I>, [name=<I>script</I>, <I>exports</I>, <I>build_dir</I>, <I>src_dir</I>, <I>duplicate</I>])

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to execute
one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files.
There are two ways to call the
<B>SConscript</B>()

function.
<P>
The first way you can call
<B>SConscript</B>()

is to explicitly specify one or more
<I>scripts</I>

as the first argument.
A single script may be specified as a string;
multiple scripts must be specified as a list
(either explicitly or as created by
a function like
<B>Split</B>()).

<P>
The second way you can call
<B>SConscript</B>()

is to specify a list of (sub)directory names
as a
dirs=<I>subdirs</I>

keyword argument.
In this case,
<B>scons</B>

will, by default,
execute a subsidiary configuration file named
<B>SConscript</B>

in each of the specified directories.
You may specify a name other than
<B>SConscript</B>

by supplying an optional
name=<I>script</I>

keyword argument.
<P>
The optional 
<I>exports</I>

argument provides a list of variable names or a dictionary of
named values to export to the
<I>script(s)</I>. 

These variables are locally exported only to the specified
<I>script(s)</I>,

and do not affect the
global pool of variables used by
the
<B>Export</B>()

function.


The subsidiary
<I>script(s)</I>

must use the
<B>Import</B>()

function to import the variables.
<P>
The optional
<I>build_dir</I>

argument specifies that all of the target files
(for example, object files and executables)
that would normally be built in the subdirectory in which
<I>script</I>

resides should actually
be built in
<I>build_dir</I>.

<I>build_dir</I>

is interpreted relative to the directory
of the calling SConscript file.
<P>
The optional
<I>src_dir</I>

argument specifies that the
source files from which
the target files should be built
can be found in
<I>src_dir</I>.

<I>src_dir</I>

is interpreted relative to the directory
of the calling SConscript file.
<P>
By default,
<B>scons</B>

will link or copy (depending on the platform)
all the source files into the build directory.
This behavior may be disabled by
setting the optional
<I>duplicate</I>

argument to 0
(it is set to 1 by default),
in which case
<B>scons</B>

will refer directly to
the source files in their source directory
when building target files.
(Setting
<I>duplicate</I>=0

is usually safe, and always more efficient
than the default of
<I>duplicate</I>=1,

but it may cause build problems in certain end-cases,
such as compiling from source files that
are generated by the build.)
<P>
Any variables returned by 
<I>script </I>

using 
<B>Return</B>()

will be returned by the call to
<B>SConscript</B>().

<P>
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscript('subdir/SConscript')
foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

<DT>SConscriptChdir(<I>value</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.SConscriptChdir(<I>value</I>)

<DD>
By default,
<B>scons</B>

changes its working directory
to the directory in which each
subsidiary SConscript file lives.
This behavior may be disabled
by specifying either:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
SConscriptChdir(0)
env.SConscriptChdir(0)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
in which case
<B>scons</B>

will stay in the top-level directory
while reading all SConscript files.
(This may be necessary when building from repositories,
when all the directories in which SConscript files may be found
don't necessarily exist locally.)
<P>
You may enable and disable
this ability by calling
SConscriptChdir()
multiple times:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
SConscriptChdir(0)
SConscript('foo/SConscript')    # will not chdir to foo
<A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+env.SConscriptChdir">env.SConscriptChdir</A>(1)

<DD>
<DT>env.SConsignFile([<I>file</I>,<I>dbm_module</I>])

<DD>
This tells
<B>scons</B>

to store all file signatures
in the specified
<I>file</I>.

If the
<I>file</I>

is omitted,
<B>.sconsign.dbm</B>

is used by default.
If
<I>file</I>

is not an absolute path name,
the file is placed in the same directory as the top-level
<B>SConstruct</B>

file.
<P>
The optional
<I>dbm_module</I>

argument can be used to specify

<DT>SetOption(<I>name</I>, <I>value</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.SetOption(<I>name</I>, <I>value</I>)

<DD>
This function provides a way to set a select subset of the scons command
line options from a SConscript file. The options supported are:
<B>clean</B>

which corresponds to -c, --clean, and --remove;
<B>duplicate</B>

which 
corresponds to --duplicate;
<B>implicit_cache</B>

which corresponds to --implicit-cache;
<B>max_drift</B>

which corresponds to --max-drift;

<DT>SideEffect(<I>side_effect</I>, <I>target</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.SideEffect(<I>side_effect</I>, <I>target</I>)

<DD>
Declares
<I>side_effect</I>

as a side effect of building
<I>target</I>.

Both 
<I>side_effect </I>

and
<I>target</I>

can be a list, a file name, or a node.
A side effect is a target that is created
as a side effect of building other targets.
For example, a Windows PDB
file is created as a side effect of building the .obj
files for a static library.
If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands,
<B>scons</B>

will ensure that only one set of commands
is executed at a time.
Consequently, you only need to use this method
for side-effect targets that are built as a result of
multiple build commands.
<P>

<DT>SourceCode(<I>entries</I>, <I>builder</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.SourceCode(<I>entries</I>, <I>builder</I>)

<DD>
Arrange for non-existent source files to
be fetched from a source code management system
using the specified
<I>builder</I>.

The specified
<I>entries</I>

may be a Node, string or list of both,
and may represent either individual
source files or directories in which
source files can be found.
<P>
For any non-existent source files,
<B>scons</B>

will search up the directory tree
and use the first
<B>SourceCode</B>

builder it finds.
The specified
<I>builder</I>

may be
<B>None</B>,

in which case
<B>scons</B>

will not use a builder to fetch
source files for the specified
<I>entries</I>,

even if a
<B>SourceCode</B>

builder has been specified
for a directory higher up the tree.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

will, by default,
fetch files from SCCS or RCS subdirectories
without explicit configuration.
This takes some extra processing time
to search for the necessary
source code management files on disk.
You can avoid these extra searches
and speed up your build a little
by disabling these searches as follows:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env.SourceCode('.', None)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
Note that if the specified
<I>builder</I>

is one you create by hand,
it must have an associated
construction environment to use
when fetching a source file.
<P>
<B>scons</B>

provides a set of canned factory
functions that return appropriate
Builders for various popular
source code management systems.
Canonical examples of invocation include:

<DT>SourceSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.SourceSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
This function tells SCons what type of signature to use for source files:
<B>MD5</B>

or
<B>timestamp</B>.

If the environment method is used,
the specified type of source signature
is only used when deciding whether targets
built with that environment are up-to-date or must be rebuilt.
If the global function is used,
the specified type of source signature becomes the default
used for all decisions
about whether targets are up-to-date.
<P>
&quot;MD5&quot; means the signature of a source file
is the MD5 checksum of its contents.
&quot;timestamp&quot; means the signature of a source file
is its timestamp (modification time).
There is no different between the two behaviors
for Python
<B>Value</B>()

node objects.
&quot;MD5&quot; signatures take longer to compute,
but are more accurate than &quot;timestamp&quot; signatures.
The default is &quot;MD5&quot;.
<P>

<DT>Split(<I>arg</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.Split(<I>arg</I>)

<DD>
Returns a list of file names or other objects.
If arg is a string,
it will be split on strings of white-space characters
within the string,
making it easier to write long lists of file names.
If arg is already a list,
the list will be returned untouched.
If arg is any other type of object,
it will be returned as a list
containing just the object.
<P>

<P>

<DT>TargetSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
<DT>env.TargetSignatures(<I>type</I>)

<DD>
This function tells SCons what type of signatures to use
for target files:
<B>build</B>

or
<B>content</B>.

If the environment method is used,
the specified type of signature is only used
for targets built with that environment.
If the global function is used,
the specified type of signature becomes the default
used for all target files that
don't have an explicit target signature type
specified for their environments.
<P>
&quot;build&quot; means the signature of a target file
is made by concatenating all of the
signatures of all its source files.
&quot;content&quot; means the signature of a target
file is an MD5 checksum of its contents.
&quot;build&quot; signatures are usually faster to compute,
but &quot;content&quot; signatures can prevent unnecessary rebuilds
when a target file is rebuilt to the exact same contents
as the previous build.
The default is &quot;build&quot;.

The value of $_CPPDEFFLAGS is created
by appending $CPPDEFPREFIX and $CPPDEFSUFFIX
to the beginning and end
of each directory in $CPPDEFINES.
<P>
<DT>CPPDEFPREFIX<DD>
The prefix used to specify preprocessor definitions
on the C compiler command line.
This will be appended to the beginning of each definition
in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable
when the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.
<P>
<DT>CPPDEFSUFFIX<DD>
The suffix used to specify preprocessor definitions
on the C compiler command line.
This will be appended to the end of each definition
in the $CPPDEFINES construction variable
when the $_CPPDEFFLAGS variable is automatically generated.
<P>
<DT>CPPFLAGS<DD>
User-specified C preprocessor options.
These will be included in any command that uses the C preprocessor,
including not just compilation of C and C++ source files
via the $CCCOM, $SHCCCOM, $CXXCOM and $SHCXXCOM command lines,
but also the $FORTRANPPCOM, $SHFORTRANPPCOM,
$F77PPCOM and $SHF77PPCOM command lines
used to compile a Fortran source file,

<P>
<DT>_CPPINCFLAGS<DD>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the C preprocessor command-line options
for specifying directories to be searched for include files.
The value of $_CPPINCFLAGS is created
by appending $INCPREFIX and $INCSUFFIX
to the beginning and end
of each directory in $CPPPATH.
<P>
<DT>CPPPATH<DD>
The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include
directories. The C/C++ implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in CCFLAGS or CXXFLAGS because the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note:
directory names in CPPPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command. To force

The list of directories that will be searched for libraries.
The implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in $LINKFLAGS or $SHLINKFLAGS
because the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note:
directory names in LIBPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command. To force 
<B>scons</B>

to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
The directory look-up can also be forced using the 
<B>Dir</B>()

function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
libs = Dir('libs')
env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT><DD>
The directory list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
$_LIBDIRFLAGS
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
$LIBDIRPREFIX and $LIBDIRSUFFIX
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in $LIBPATH.
Any command lines you define that need
the LIBPATH directory list should
include $_LIBDIRFLAGS:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(LINKCOM=&quot;my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>LIBPREFIX<DD>
The prefix used for (static) library file names.
A default value is set for each platform
(posix, win32, os2, etc.),
but the value is overridden by individual tools
(ar, mslib, sgiar, sunar, tlib, etc.)
to reflect the names of the libraries they create.
<P>
<DT>LIBPREFIXES<DD>
An array of legal prefixes for library file names.
<P>
<DT>LIBS<DD>
A list of one or more libraries
that will be linked with

The library list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
$_LIBFLAGS
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
$LIBLINKPREFIX and $LIBLINKSUFFIX
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in $LIBS.
Any command lines you define that need
the LIBS library list should
include $_LIBFLAGS:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(LINKCOM=&quot;my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>LIBSUFFIX<DD>
The suffix used for (static) library file names.
A default value is set for each platform
(posix, win32, os2, etc.),

to reflect the names of the libraries they create.
<P>
<DT>LIBSUFFIXES<DD>
An array of legal suffixes for library file names.
<P>
<DT>LINK<DD>
The linker.
<P>
<DT>LINKFLAGS<DD>

Note that this variable should
<I>not</I>

contain
<B>-l</B>

(or similar) options for linking with the libraries listed in $LIBS,
nor
<B>-L</B>

(or similar) library search path options
that scons generates automatically from $LIBPATH.
See

<P>
<DT>MSVS_IGNORE_IDE_PATHS<DD>
Tells the MS Visual Studio tools to use minimal INCLUDE, LIB, and PATH settings,
instead of the settings from the IDE.
<P>
For Visual Studio, SCons will (by default) automatically determine
where MSVS is installed, and use the LIB, INCLUDE, and PATH variables
set by the IDE.  You can override this behavior by setting these
variables after Environment initialization, or by setting
<B>MSVS_IGNORE_IDE_PATHS = 1</B>

in the Environment initialization.
Specifying this will not leave these unset, but will set them to a
minimal set of paths needed to run the tools successfully.
<P>

<P>
<DT>MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS<DD>
Tells the MS Visual Studio tool(s) to use
the MFC directories in its default paths
for compiling and linking.
Under MSVS version 6,
setting
<B>MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS</B>

to a non-zero value
adds the
<B>ATL\\include</B>

and
<B>MFC\\include</B>

directories to
the default
<B>INCLUDE</B>

external environment variable,
and adds the
<B>MFC\\lib</B>

directory to
the default
<B>LIB</B>

external environment variable.
Under MSVS version 7,
setting
<B>MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS</B>

to a non-zero value
adds the
<B>atlmfc\\include</B>

directory to the default
<B>INCLUDE</B>

external environment variable,
and adds the
<B>atlmfc\\lib</B>

directory to the default
<B>LIB</B>

external environment variable.
The current default value is
<B>1</B>,

which means these directories
are added to the paths by default.
This default value is likely to change
in a future release,
so users who want the ATL and MFC
values included in their paths
are encouraged to enable the
<B>MSVS_USE_MFC_DIRS</B>

value explicitly
to avoid future incompatibility.
This variable has no effect if the
<B>INCLUDE</B>

or
<B>LIB</B>

environment variables are set explictly.
<P>
<DT>MSVS_VERSION<DD>
Sets the preferred version of MSVS to use.
<P>
SCons will (by default) select the latest version of MSVS
installed on your machine.  So, if you have version 6 and version 7
(MSVS .NET) installed, it will prefer version 7.  You can override this by
specifying the 
<B>MSVS_VERSION</B>

variable in the Environment initialization, setting it to the
appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example).
If the given version isn't installed, tool initialization will fail.

<P>
<DT>MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX<DD>
The suffix used for Microsoft Visual Studio solution (DSW) files.
The default value is
<B>.sln</B>

when using Visual Studio version 7.x (.NET),
and
<B>.dsw</B>

when using earlier versions of Visual Studio.
<P>
<DT>no_import_lib<DD>
When set to non-zero,
suppresses creation of a corresponding Win32 static import lib by the
<B>SharedLibrary</B>

builder when used with
MinGW or Microsoft Visual Studio.
This also suppresses creation
of an export (.exp) file
when using Microsoft Visual Studio.
<P>
<DT>OBJPREFIX<DD>
The prefix used for (static) object file names.
<P>
<DT>OBJSUFFIX<DD>
The suffix used for (static) object file names.

<P>
<DT>P4FLAGS<DD>
General options that are passed to Perforce.
<P>
<DT>PCH<DD>
The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used when compiling
object files. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++.
When this variable is
defined SCons will add options to the compiler command line to
cause it to use the precompiled header, and will also set up the
dependencies for the PCH file. Example: 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['PCH'] = 'StdAfx.pch'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>PCHSTOP<DD>
This variable specifies how much of a source file is precompiled. This
variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++, or when
the PCH variable is not being used. When this variable is define it
must be a string that is the name of the header that
is included at the end of the precompiled portion of the source files, or
the empty string if the &quot;#pragma hrdstop&quot; construct is being used:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>PDB<DD>
The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging information for
object files, shared libraries, and programs. This variable is ignored by
tools other than Microsoft Visual C++.
When this variable is
defined SCons will add options to the compiler and linker command line to
cause them to generate external debugging information, and will also set up the
dependencies for the PDB file. Example:
<P>

<DT>QTDIR<DD>
The qt tool tries to take this from os.environ.
It also initializes all QT_*
construction variables listed below.
(Note that all paths are constructed
with python's os.path.join() method,
but are listed here with the '/' separator
for easier reading.)
In addition, the construction environment
variables CPPPATH, LIBPATH, LIBS, PROGEMITTER, SHLIBEMITTER and LIBEMITTER
are modified. Because the build-performance is affected when using this tool,
you have to explicitly specify it at Environment creation:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Environment(tools=['default','qt'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The qt tool supports the following operations:
<P>
<B>Automatic moc file generation from header files.</B>

You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you.
However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have
the same filebase as your implementation file and must stay in the same
directory. It must have one of the suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You 
can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0.
See also the corresponding builder method
<B>Moc()</B>

<P>
<B>Automatic moc file generation from cxx files.</B>

As stated in the qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of 
the cxx file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated
by the transformation ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}&lt;basename&gt;${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default
&lt;basename&gt;.moc. A warning is generated after building the moc file, if you 
do not include the correct file. If you are using BuildDir, you may 
need to specify duplicate=1. You can turn off automatic moc file generation 
by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0. See also the corresponding builder method
<B>Moc()</B>

<P>
<B>Automatic handling of .ui files.</B>

The implementation files generated from .ui files are handled much the same
as yacc or lex files. Each .ui file given as a source of Program, Library or
SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration file, the 
implementation file and a moc file. Because there are also generated headers, 
you may need to specify duplicate=1 in calls to BuildDir. See also the corresponding builder method
<B>Uic()</B>

<P>

<H3>Configure Contexts</H3>

<P>
<B>scons</B>

supports
<I>configure contexts,</I>

an integrated mechanism similar to the
various AC_CHECK macros in GNU autoconf
for testing for the existence of C header
files, libraries, etc.
In contrast to autoconf,
<B>scons</B>

does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values,
but uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values
up to date. 
The following methods can be used to perform checks:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Configure(<I>env</I>, [<I>custom_tests</I>, <I>conf_dir</I>, <I>log_file</I>])

<DD>
<DT>env.Configure([<I>custom_tests</I>, <I>conf_dir</I>, <I>log_file</I>])

<DD>
This creates a configure context, which can be used to perform checks.
<I>env</I>

specifies the environment for building the tests.
This environment may be modified when performing checks.
<I>custom_tests</I>

is a dictionary containing custom tests.
See also the section about custom tests below. 
By default, no custom tests are added to the configure context.
<I>conf_dir</I>

specifies a directory where the test cases are built.
Note that this directory is not used for building
normal targets.
The default value is the directory
#/.sconf_temp.
<I>log_file</I>

specifies a file which collects the output from commands
that are executed to check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc.
The default is the file #/config.log.
If you are using the
<B>BuildDir</B>

method,
you may want to specify a subdirectory under your build directory.
<P>




A created
<B>Configure</B>

instance has the following associated methods:
<P>
<DT>Configure.Finish(<I>self</I>)

<DD>
This method should be called after configuration is done.
It returns the environment as modified
by the configuration checks performed.
After this method is called, no further checks can be performed
with this configuration context.
However, you can create a new 
Configure

context to perform additional checks.
Only one context should be active at a time.
<P>
The following Checks are predefined.
(This list will likely grow larger as time
goes by and developers contribute new useful tests.)
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckHeader(<I>self</I>, <I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
Checks if 
<I>header</I>

is usable in the specified language.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
<B>#include</B>

lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
The optional argument 
<I>include_quotes </I>

must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote.
By default, both characters  are &quot; (double quote).
The optional argument
<I>language</I>

should be either
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check.
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckCHeader(<I>self</I>, <I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>])

<DD>
This is a wrapper around
<B>Configure.CheckHeader</B>

which checks if 
<I>header</I>

is usable in the C language.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
<B>#include</B>

lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
The optional argument 
<I>include_quotes </I>

must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote (both default
to N'34').
Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckCXXHeader(<I>self</I>, <I>header</I>, [<I>include_quotes</I>])

<DD>
This is a wrapper around
<B>Configure.CheckHeader</B>

which checks if 
<I>header</I>

is usable in the C++ language.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
<B>#include</B>

lines should precede the

The optional argument 
<I>include_quotes </I>

must be
a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
quote and the second character denotes the closing quote (both default

Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. 
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckFunc(<I>self</I>, <I>function_name</I>, [<I>language</I>])

<DD>
Checks if the specified
C or C++ function is available.
<I>function_name</I>

is the name of the function to check for.
The optional
<I>language</I>

argument should be
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is &quot;C&quot;.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckLib(<I>self</I>, [<I>library</I>, <I>symbol</I>, <I>header</I>, <I>language</I>, <I>autoadd</I>])

<DD>
Checks if 
<I>library </I>

provides 
<I>symbol</I>.

If the value of
<I>autoadd</I>

is 1 and the library provides the specified
<I>symbol</I>,

appends the library to the LIBS construction environment variable.
<I>library </I>

may also be None (the default),
in which case 
<I>symbol </I>

is checked with the current LIBS variable,
or a list of library names,
in which case each library in the list
will be checked for
<I>symbol</I>.

The default
<I>symbol</I>

is &quot;main&quot;,
which just check if
you can link against the specified
<I>library</I>.

The optional
<I>language</I>

argument should be
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is &quot;C&quot;.
The default value for
<I>autoadd</I>

It is assumed, that the C-language is used.
This method returns 1 on success and 0 on error.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckLibWithHeader(<I>self</I>, <I>library</I>, <I>header</I>, <I>language</I>, [<I>call</I>, <I>autoadd</I>])

<DD>
<P>
In contrast to the 
Configure.CheckLib

call, this call provides a more sophisticated way to check against libraries.
Again, 
<I>library</I>

specifies the library or a list of libraries to check. 
<I>header</I>

specifies a header to check for.
<I>header</I>

may be a list,
in which case the last item in the list
is the header file to be checked,
and the previous list items are
header files whose
<B>#include</B>

lines should precede the
header line being checked for.
<I>language</I>

may be one of 'C','c','CXX','cxx','C++' and 'c++'.
<I>call</I>

can be any valid expression (with a trailing ';'). The default is 'main();'.
<I>autoadd</I>

specifies whether to add the library to the environment (only if the check 
succeeds). This method returns 1 on success and 0 on error.
<P>
<DT>Configure.CheckType(<I>self</I>, <I>type_name</I>, [<I>includes</I>, <I>language</I>])

<DD>
Checks for the existence of a type defined by
<B>typedef</B>.

<I>type_name</I>

specifies the typedef name to check for.
<I>includes</I>

is a string containing one or more
<B>#include</B>

lines that will be inserted into the program
that will be run to test for the existence of the type.
The optional
<I>language</I>

argument should be
<B>C</B>

or
<B>C++</B>

and selects the compiler to be used for the check;
the default is &quot;C&quot;.
<P>




Example of a typical Configure usage:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
conf = Configure( env )
if not conf.CheckCHeader( 'math.h' ):
    print 'We really need math.h!'
    <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+Exit">Exit</A>(1)
if conf.CheckLibWithHeader( 'qt', 'qapp.h', 'c++', 'QApplication qapp(0,0);' ):
    # do stuff for qt - usage, e.g.
    conf.env.Append( CPPFLAGS = '-DWITH_QT' )
env = conf.Finish() 

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>




You can define your own custom checks. 
in addition to the predefined checks.
These are passed in a dictionary to the Configure function.
This dictionary maps the names of the checks
to user defined Python callables 
(either Python functions or class instances implementing the
<I>__call__</I>

method).
The first argument of the call is always a 
<I>CheckContext</I>

instance followed by the arguments,
which must be supplied by the user of the check.
These CheckContext instances define the following methods:
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.Message(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>)

<DD>
<P>
Usually called before the check is started. 
<I>text</I>

will be displayed to the user, e.g. 'Checking for library X...'
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.Result(<I>self,</I>, <I>res</I>)

<DD>
<P>
Usually called after the check is done. 
<I>res</I>

can be either an integer or a string. In the former case, 'ok' (res != 0) 
or 'failed' (res == 0) is displayed to the user, in the latter case the 
given string is displayed.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryCompile(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>)

<DD>
Checks if a file with the specified 
<I>extension</I>

(e.g. '.c') containing 
<I>text </I>

can be compiled using the environment's
<B>Object </B>

builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryLink(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>)

<DD>
Checks, if a file with the specified
<I>extension</I>

(e.g. '.c') containing 
<I>text </I>

can be compiled using the environment's
<B>Program</B>

builder. Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryRun(<I>self</I>, <I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>)

<DD>
Checks, if a file with the specified
<I>extension</I>

(e.g. '.c') containing 
<I>text </I>

can be compiled using the environment's
<B>Program</B>

builder. On success, the program is run. If the program
executes successfully
(that is, its return status is 0),
a tuple
<I>(1, outputStr)</I>

is returned, where
<I>outputStr</I>

is the standard output of the
program.
If the program fails execution
(its return status is non-zero),
then (0, '') is returned.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryAction(<I>self</I>, <I>action</I>, [<I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>])

<DD>
Checks if the specified
<I>action </I>

with an optional source file (contents
<I>text</I>

, extension 
<I>extension</I>

= ''
) can be executed. 
<I>action </I>

may be anything which can be converted to a 
<B>scons</B>

Action.

On success,
<I>(1, outputStr)</I>

is returned, where
<I>outputStr</I>

is the content of the target file.
On failure
<I>(0, '')</I>

is returned.
<P>
<DT>CheckContext.TryBuild(<I>self</I>, <I>builder</I>, [<I>text</I>, <I>extension</I>])

<DD>
Low level implementation for testing specific builds;
the methods above are based on this method.
Given the Builder instance
<I>builder</I>

and the optional 
<I>text</I>

of a source file with optional
<I>extension</I>,

this method returns 1 on success and 0 on failure. In addition, 
<I>self.lastTarget </I>

is set to the build target node, if the build was successful.

<H3>Construction Variable Options</H3>

<P>
Often when building software, various options need to be specified at build
time that are not known when the SConstruct/SConscript files are
written. For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non-standard
locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the
compiler. 
<B>scons</B>

provides a mechanism for overridding construction variables from the
command line or a text-based SConscript file through an Options
object. To create an Options object, call the Options() function:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Options([<I>files</I>], [<I>args</I>])

<DD>
This creates an Options object that will read construction variables from
the file or list of filenames specified in
<I>files</I>.

If no files are specified,
or the
<I>files</I>

argument is
<B>None</B>,

then no files will be read.
The optional argument
<I>args</I>

is a dictionary of
values that will override anything read from the specified files;
it is primarily intended to be passed the
<B>ARGUMENTS</B>

dictionary that holds variables
specified on the command line.
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
opts = Options('custom.py')
opts = Options('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
opts = Options(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Options objects have the following methods:
<P>
<DT>Add(<I>key</I>, [<I>help</I>, <I>default</I>, <I>validator</I>, <I>converter</I>])

<DD>
This adds a customizable construction variable to the Options object. 
<I>key</I>

is the name of the variable. 
<I>help </I>

is the help text for the variable.
<I>default </I>

is the default value of the variable.
<I>validator</I>

is called to validate the value of the variable, and should take three
arguments: key, value, and environment
<I>converter</I>

is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and
should take a single argument: value. Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
opts.Add('CC', 'The C compiler')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>AddOptions(<I>list</I>)

<DD>
A wrapper script that adds
multiple customizable construction variables
to an Options object.
<I>list</I>

is a list of tuple or list objects
that contain the arguments
for an individual call to the
<B>Add</B>

method.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
opt.AddOptions(
       ('debug', '', 0),
       ('CC', 'The C compiler'),
       ('VALIDATE', 'An option for testing validation',
        'notset', validator, None),
    )

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Update(<I>env</I>, [<I>args</I>])

<DD>
This updates a construction environment
<I>env</I>

with the customized construction variables. Normally this method is not
called directly, but is called indirectly by passing the Options object to
the Environment() function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment(options=opts)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Save(<I>filename</I>, <I>env</I>)

<DD>
This saves the currently set options into a script file named  
<I>filename</I>

that can be used on the next invocation to automatically load the current
settings.  This method combined with the Options method can be used to
support caching of options between runs.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env = Environment()
opts = Options(['options.cache', 'custom.py'])
opts.Add(...)
opts.Update(env)
opts.Save('options.cache', env)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>GenerateHelpText(<I>env</I>, [<I>sort</I>])

<DD>
This generates help text documenting the customizable construction
variables suitable to passing in to the Help() function. 
<I>env</I>

is the construction environment that will be used to get the actual values
of customizable variables. Calling with 
an optional
<I>sort</I>

function
will cause the output to be sorted
by the specified argument.
The specific
<I>sort</I>

function
should take two arguments
and return
-1, 0 or 1
(like the standard Python
<I>cmp</I>

function).
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))
Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env, sort=cmp))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The text based SConscript file is executed as a Python script, and the
global variables are queried for customizable construction
variables. Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
CC = 'my_cc'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
To make it more convenient to work with customizable Options,
<B>scons</B>

provides a number of functions
that make it easy to set up
various types of Options:
<P>
<DT>BoolOption(<I>key</I>, <I>help</I>, <I>default</I>)

<DD>
Return a tuple of arguments
to set up a Boolean option.
The option will use
the specified name
<I>key</I>,

have a default value of
<I>default</I>,

and display the specified
<I>help</I>

text.
The option will interpret the values
<B>y</B>,

<B>yes</B>,

<B>t</B>,

<B>true</B>,

<B>1</B>,

<B>on</B>

and
<B>all</B>

as true,
and the values
<B>n</B>,

<B>no</B>,

<H3>Builder Objects</H3>

<B>scons</B>

can be extended to build different types of targets
by adding new Builder objects
to a construction environment.
<I>In general</I>,

you should only need to add a new Builder object
when you want to build a new type of file or other external target.
If you just want to invoke a different compiler or other tool
to build a Program, Object, Library, or any other
type of output file for which
<B>scons</B>

already has an existing Builder,
it is generally much easier to
use those existing Builders
in a construction environment
that sets the appropriate construction variables
(CC, LINK, etc.).
<P>
Builder objects are created
using the
<B>Builder </B>

function.
The
<B>Builder</B>

function accepts the following arguments:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>action<DD>
The command line string used to build the target from the source. 
<B>action</B>

can also be:
a list of strings representing the command
to be executed and its arguments
(suitable for enclosing white space in an argument),
a dictionary
mapping source file name suffixes to
any combination of command line strings
(if the builder should accept multiple source file extensions),
a Python function;
an Action object
(see the next section);
or a list of any of the above.
<P>
An action function
takes three arguments:
<I>source </I>

- a list of source nodes, 
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment.
<P>
<DT>prefix<DD>
The prefix that will be prepended to the target file name.
This may be a simple string,  or a callable object that takes
two arguments, a construction environment and a list of sources,
and returns a prefix.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<P>
<DT>suffix<DD>
The suffix that will be appended to the target file name.
This may be a simple string, or a callable object that takes
two arguments, a construction environment and a list of sources,
and returns a suffix.
If the suffix is a string, then
<B>scons</B>

will append a '.' to the beginning of the
suffix if it's not already there.
The string returned by callable object
is untouched and must append its own '.'
to the beginning if one is desired.

<P>
<DT>src_suffix<DD>
The expected source file name suffix.
<P>
<DT>target_scanner<DD>
A Scanner object that
will be invoked to find
implicit dependencies for this target file.
This keyword argument should be used
for Scanner objects that find
implicit dependencies
based only on the target file
and the construction environment,
<I>not </I>

for implicit

for information about creating Scanner objects.)
<P>
<DT>source_scanner<DD>
A Scanner object that
will be invoked to
find implicit dependences in
any source files
used to build this target file.
This is where you would
specify a scanner to
find things like
<B>#include</B>

lines in source files.
(See the section &quot;Scanner Objects,&quot; below,
for information about creating Scanner objects.)
<P>
<DT>target_factory<DD>
A factory function that the Builder will use
to turn any targets specified as strings into SCons Nodes.
By default,
SCons assumes that all targets are files.
Other useful target_factory
values include
<B>Dir</B>,

for when a Builder creates a directory target,
and
<B>Entry</B>,

for when a Builder can create either a file
or directory target.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'MakeDirectory':MakeDirectoryBuilder})
env.MakeDirectory('new_directory')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>source_factory<DD>
A factory function that the Builder will use
to turn any sources specified as strings into SCons Nodes.
By default,
SCons assumes that all source are files.
Other useful source_factory
values include
<B>Dir</B>,

for when a Builder uses a directory as a source,
and
<B>Entry</B>,

for when a Builder can use files
or directories (or both) as sources.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
CollectBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, source_factory=Entry)
env = Environment()
env.Append(BUILDERS = {'Collect':CollectBuilder})
env.Collect('archive', ['directory_name', 'file_name'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>emitter<DD>
A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and source
lists before dependencies are established
and the target(s) are actually built.
<B>emitter</B>

can also be a string containing a construction variable to expand
to an emitter function or list of functions,
or a dictionary mapping source file suffixes
to emitter functions.
(Only the suffix of the first source file
is used to select the actual emitter function
from an emitter dictionary.)
<P>
An emitter function
takes three arguments:
<I>source </I>

- a list of source nodes, 
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment.
An emitter must return a tuple containing two lists,
the list of targets to be built by this builder,
and the list of sources for this builder.
<P>
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The 
<I>generator</I>

and
<I>action</I>

arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.
<P>
<DT>multi<DD>
Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple times for
the same target file(s). The default is 0, which means the builder
can not be called multiple times for the same target file(s). Calling a
builder multiple times for the same target simply adds additional source
files to the target; it is not allowed to change the environment associated
with the target, specify addition environment overrides, or associate a different
builder with the target. 
<P>
<DT>env<DD>
A construction environment that can be used
to fetch source code using this Builder.
(Note that this environment is
<I>not</I>

used for normal builds of normal target files,
which use the environment that was
used to call the Builder for the target file.)
<P>
<DT>generator<DD>
A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed to build
the target(s) from the source(s).
The returned action(s) may be
an Action object, or anything that
can be converted into an Action object
(see the next section).
<P>
The generator function
takes four arguments:
<I>source </I>

- a list of source nodes, 
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment,
<I>for_signature</I>

- a Boolean value that specifies
whether the generator is being called
for generating a build signature
(as opposed to actually executing the command).
Example:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
    return [[&quot;gcc&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-o&quot;] + target + source] 

b = Builder(generator=g)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>src_builder<DD>
Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does not match
any of the suffixes of the builder. Using this argument produces a
multi-stage builder.
<P>
<DT>single_source<DD>
Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per call. Giving
more than one source files without target files results in implicitely calling
the builder multiple times (once for each source given). Giving multiple 
source files together with target files results in a UserError exception.
<P>

<DT><DD>
The 
<I>generator</I>

and
<I>action</I>

arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.
<P>
<DT>env<DD>
A construction environment that can be used
to fetch source code using this Builder.
(Note that this environment is
<I>not</I>

used for normal builds of normal target files,
which use the environment that was
used to call the Builder for the target file.)
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
b = Builder(action=&quot;build &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET&quot;)
env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'MyBuild' : b})
env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg = 'xyzzy')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>

Any additional keyword arguments supplied
when a Builder object is created
(that is, when the Builder() function is called)
will be set in the executing construction
environment when the Builder object is called.
The canonical example here would be
to set a construction variable to 
the repository of a source code system.
<P>
Any additional keyword arguments supplied
when a Builder
<I>object</I>

is called
will only be associated with the target
created by that particular Builder call
(and any other files built as a
result of the call).
<P>
These extra keyword arguments are passed to the
following functions:
command generator functions,
function Actions,
and emitter functions.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Action Objects</H3>

<P>
The
<B>Builder()</B>

function will turn its
<B>action</B>

keyword argument into an appropriate
internal Action object.
You can also explicity create Action objects
using the
<B>Action</B>()

global function,
which can then be passed to the
<B>Builder</B>()

function.
This can be used to configure
an Action object more flexibly,
or it may simply be more efficient
than letting each separate Builder object
create a separate Action
when multiple
Builder objects need to do the same thing.
<P>
The
<B>Action</B>()

global function
returns an appropriate object for the action
represented by the type of the first argument:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Action<DD>
If the first argument is already an Action object,
the object is simply returned.
<P>
<DT>String<DD>
If the first argument is a string,
a command-line Action is returned.

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>








<P>
<P>
<DT>List<DD>
If the first argument is a list,
then a list of Action objects is returned.
An Action object is created as necessary
for each element in the list.
If an element
<I>within</I>

the list is itself a list,
the internal list is the
command and arguments to be executed via
the command line.
This allows white space to be enclosed
in an argument by defining
a command in a list within a list:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Function<DD>
If the first argument is a Python function,
a function Action is returned.
The Python function takes three keyword arguments,
<B>target</B>

(a Node object representing the target file),
<B>source</B>

(a Node object representing the source file)
and
<B>env</B>

(the construction environment
used for building the target file).
The
<B>target</B>

and
<B>source</B>

arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
more than one target file or source file.
The actual target and source file name(s) may
be retrieved from their Node objects
via the built-in Python str() function:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
target_file_name = str(target)
source_file_names = map(lambda x: str(x), source)

</PRE>

</DL>


<DT><DD>
The function should return
<B>0</B>

or
<B>None</B>

to indicate a successful build of the target file(s).
The function may raise an exception
or return a non-zero exit status
to indicate an unsuccessful build.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def build_it(target = None, source = None, env = None):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0
 
a = Action(build_it)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The second, optional argument
is a Python function that returns
a string to be printed to describe the action being executed.
Like a function to build a file,
this function takes three arguments:
<B>target</B>

(a Node object representing the target file),
<B>source</B>

(a Node object representing the source file)
and
<B>env</B>

(a construction environment).
The
<B>target</B>

and
<B>source</B>

arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is
more than one target file or source file.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

def string_it(target, source, env):
    return &quot;building '%s' from '%s'&quot; % (target[0], source[0])

# Use a positional argument.
a = Action(build_it, string_it)

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
The third, also optional argument
is a list of construction variables
whose values will be included
in the signature of the Action
when deciding whether a target should
be rebuilt because the action changed.
This is necessary whenever you want a target to
be rebuilt when a specific
construction variable changes,
because the underlying Python code for a function
will not change when the value of the construction variable does.
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
    open(target[0], 'w').write(env['XXX'])

def string_it(target, source):
    return &quot;building '%s' from '%s'&quot; % (target[0], source[0])

# Use positional arguments.
a = Action(build_it, string_it, ['XXX'])

# Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

None is returned.

<H3>Miscellaneous Action Functions</H3>

<P>
<B>scons</B>

supplies a number of functions
that arrange for various common
file and directory manipulations
to be performed.
These are similar in concept to &quot;tasks&quot; in the 
Ant build tool,
although the implementation is slightly different.
These functions do not actually
perform the specified action
at the time the function is called,
but instead return an Action object
that can be executed at the
appropriate time.
(In Object-Oriented terminology,
these are actually
Action
<I>Factory</I>

functions
that return Action objects.)
<P>
In practice,
there are two natural ways
that these
Action Functions
are intended to be used.
<P>
First,
if you need
to perform the action
at the time the SConscript
file is being read,
you can use the
<B>Execute</B>

global function to do so:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Touch('file'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Second,
you can use these functions
to supply Actions in a list
for use by the
<B>Command</B>

method.
This can allow you to
perform more complicated
sequences of file manipulation
without relying
on platform-specific
external commands:
that 

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

env = Environment(TMPBUILD = '/tmp/builddir')
env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',

             &quot;cd $TMPBUILD &amp;&amp; make&quot;,
             Delete('$TMPBUILD')])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Chmod(<I>dest</I>, <I>mode</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action object that
changes the permissions on the specified
<I>dest</I>

file or directory to the specified
<I>mode</I>.

Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Chmod('file', 0755))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'),
             Chmod('$TARGET', 0755)])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Copy(<I>dest</I>, <I>src</I>)

<DD>
Returns an Action object
that will copy the
<I>src</I>

source file or directory to the
<I>dest</I>

destination file or directory.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in',
            Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<DT>Delete(<I>entry</I>, [<I>must_exist</I>])

<DD>
Returns an Action that
deletes the specified
<I>entry</I>,

which may be a file or a directory tree.
If a directory is specified,
the entire directory tree
will be removed.
If the
<I>must_exist</I>

flag is set,
then a Python error will be thrown
if the specified entry does not exist;
the default is
<B>must_exist=0</B>,

that is, the Action will silently do nothing
if the entry does not exist.
Examples:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

env.Command('foo.out', 'foo.in',
            [Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),

Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=1))

</PRE>

<P>
<DT>Mkdir(<I>dir</I>)

<H3>Variable Substitution</H3>

<P>
Before executing a command,
<B>scons</B>

performs construction variable interpolation on the strings that make up
the command line of builders.
Variables are introduced by a
<B>$</B>

prefix.
Besides construction variables, scons provides the following
variables for each command execution:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>TARGET<DD>
The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the first 
target if multiple targets are being built.
<P>
<DT>TARGETS<DD>
The file names of all targets being built.
<P>
<DT>SOURCE<DD>
The file name of the source of the build command, or the file name of the
first source if multiple sources are being built.
<P>
<DT>SOURCES<DD>
The file names of the sources of the build command.
<P>
(Note that the above variables are reserved
and may not be set in a construction environment.)
<P>
</DL>
<P>

For example, given the construction variable CC='cc', targets=['foo'], and
sources=['foo.c', 'bar.c']:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
action='$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
would produce the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Variable names may be surrounded by curly braces ({})
to separate the name from the trailing characters.
Within the curly braces, a variable name may have
a Python slice subscript appended to select one
or more items from a list.
In the previous example, the string:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
${SOURCES[1]}

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
would produce:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
bar.c

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Additionally, a variable name may
have the following special
modifiers appended within the enclosing curly braces
to modify the interpolated string:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>base<DD>
The base path of the file name,
including the directory path
but excluding any suffix.
<P>
<DT>dir<DD>
The name of the directory in which the file exists.
<P>
<DT>file<DD>
The file name,
minus any directory portion.
<P>
<DT>filebase<DD>
Just the basename of the file,
minus any suffix
and minus the directory.
<P>
<DT>suffix<DD>
Just the file suffix.
<P>
<DT>abspath<DD>
The absolute path name of the file.
<P>
<DT>posix<DD>
The POSIX form of the path,
with directories separated by
<B>/</B>

(forward slashes)
not backslashes.
This is sometimes necessary on Win32 systems
when a path references a file on other (POSIX) systems.
<P>
<DT>srcpath<DD>
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory and filename unchanged.
<P>
<DT>srcdir<DD>
The directory containing the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory part of the filename.
<P>
<DT>rsrcpath<DD>
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If the file does not exist locally but exists in
a Repository, the path in the Repository is returned.
If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory and filename unchanged.
<P>
<DT>rsrcdir<DD>
The Repository directory containing the source file linked to this file
through BuildDir.  If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
directory part of the filename.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

For example, the specified target will
expand as follows for the corresponding modifiers:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$TARGET              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${TARGET.base}       =&gt; sub/dir/file
${TARGET.dir}        =&gt; sub/dir
${TARGET.file}       =&gt; file.x
${TARGET.filebase}   =&gt; file
${TARGET.suffix}     =&gt; .x
${TARGET.abspath}    =&gt; /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x

BuildDir('sub/dir','src')
$SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.srcpath}    =&gt; src/file.x
${SOURCE.srcdir}     =&gt; src

Repository('/usr/repository')
$SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   =&gt; /usr/repository/src/file.x
${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    =&gt; /usr/repository/src

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Lastly, a variable name
may be a callable Python function
associated with a
construction variable in the environment.
The function should
take four arguments:
<I>target</I>

- a list of target nodes,
<I>source </I>

- a list of source nodes, 
<I>env</I>

- the construction environment,
<I>for_signature</I>

- a Boolean value that specifies
whether the function is being called
for generating a build signature.
SCons will insert whatever
the called function returns
into the expanded string:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return &quot;bar&quot;

# Will expand $BAR to &quot;bar baz&quot;
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR=&quot;$FOO baz&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
You can use this feature to pass arguments to a
Python function by creating a callable class
that stores one or more arguments in an object,
and then uses them when the
<B>__call__()</B>

method is called.
Note that in this case,
the entire variable expansion must
be enclosed by curly braces
so that the arguments will
be associated with the
instantiation of the class:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
class foo:
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return arg + &quot; bar&quot;

# Will expand $BAR to &quot;my argument bar baz&quot;
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR=&quot;${FOO('my argument')} baz&quot;)

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<P>

The special pseudo-variables
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

may be used to surround parts of a command line
that may change
<I>without</I>

causing a rebuild--that is,
which are not included in the signature
of target files built with this command.
All text between
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

will be removed from the command line
before it is added to file signatures,
and the
<B>$(</B>

and
<B>$)</B>

will be removed before the command is executed.
For example, the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). &gt; $TARGET

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<P>

would execute the command:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo Last build occurred $TODAY. &gt; $TARGET

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
<P>

but the command signature added to any target files would be:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
echo Last build occurred  . &gt; $TARGET

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables into
command lines:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>String<DD>
When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space delimited list of
command line arguments. 
<P>
<DT>List<DD>
When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line
arguments. Each element of the list is converted to a string.
<P>
<DT>Other<DD>
Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and
interpreted as a single command line argument.
<P>
<DT>Newline<DD>
Newline characters (\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is done after
all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e.g. file names) to
contain embedded newline characters. This limitation will likely go away in
a future version of SCons.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAT">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Scanner Objects</H3>

<P>
You can use the
<B>Scanner</B>

function to define
objects to scan
new file types for implicit dependencies.
Scanner accepts the following arguments:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>function<DD>
A Python function that will process
the Node (file)
and return a list of strings (file names)
representing the implicit
dependencies found in the contents.
The function takes three or four arguments:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;scanner_function(node,&nbsp;env,&nbsp;path):
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def&nbsp;scanner_function(node,&nbsp;env,&nbsp;path,&nbsp;arg):
<P>
The
<B>node</B>

argument is the internal
SCons node representing the file.
Use
<B>str(node)</B>

to fetch the name of the file, and
<B>node.get_contents()</B>

to fetch contents of the file.
<P>
The
<B>env</B>

argument is the construction environment for the scan.
Fetch values from it using the
<B>env.Dictionary()</B>

method.
<P>
The
<B>path</B>

argument is a tuple (or list)
of directories that can be searched
for files.
This will usually be the tuple returned by the
<B>path_function</B>

argument (see below).
<P>
The
<B>arg</B>

argument is the argument supplied
when the scanner was created, if any.
<P>
<DT>name<DD>
The name of the Scanner.
This is mainly used
to identify the Scanner internally.
<P>
<DT>argument<DD>
An optional argument that, if specified,
will be passed to the scanner function
(described above)
and the path function
(specified below).
<P>
<DT>skeys<DD>
An optional list that can be used to
determine which scanner should be used for
a given Node.
In the usual case of scanning for file names,
this argument will be a list of suffixes
for the different file types that this
Scanner knows how to scan.
If the argument is a string,
then it will be expanded 
into a list by the current environment.
<P>
<DT>path_function<DD>
A Python function that takes
two or three arguments:
a construction environment, directory Node,
and optional argument supplied
when the scanner was created.
The
<B>path_function</B>

returns a tuple of directories
that can be searched for files to be returned
by this Scanner object.
<P>
<DT>node_class<DD>
The class of Node that should be returned
by this Scanner object.
Any strings or other objects returned
by the scanner function
that are not of this class
will be run through the
<B>node_factory</B>

function.
<P>
<DT>node_factory<DD>
A Python function that will take a string
or other object
and turn it into the appropriate class of Node
to be returned by this Scanner object.
<P>
<DT>scan_check<DD>
An optional Python function that takes two arguments,
a Node (file) and a construction environment,
and returns whether the
Node should, in fact,
be scanned for dependencies.
This check can be used to eliminate unnecessary
calls to the scanner function when,
for example, the underlying file
represented by a Node does not yet exist.
<P>
<DT>recursive<DD>
An optional flag that
specifies whether this scanner should be re-invoked
on the dependency files returned by the scanner.
When this flag is not set,
the Node subsystem will
only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned,
and not (for example) also on the files
specified by the #include lines
in the file being scanned.

<H2>SYSTEM-SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR</H2>

SCons and its configuration files are very portable,
due largely to its implementation in Python.
There are, however, a few portability
issues waiting to trap the unwary.
<A NAME="lbAV">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>.C file suffix</H3>

SCons handles the upper-case
<B>.C</B>

file suffix differently,
depending on the capabilities of
the underlying system.
On a case-sensitive system
such as Linux or UNIX,
SCons treats a file with a 
<B>.C</B>

suffix as a C++ source file.
On a case-insensitive system
such as Windows,
SCons treats a file with a 
<B>.C</B>

suffix as a C source file.
<A NAME="lbAW">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>.F file suffix</H3>

SCons handles the upper-case
<B>.F</B>

file suffix differently,
depending on the capabilities of
the underlying system.
On a case-sensitive system
such as Linux or UNIX,
SCons treats a file with a 
<B>.F</B>

suffix as a Fortran source file
that is to be first run through
the standard C preprocessor.
On a case-insensitive system
such as Windows,
SCons treats a file with a 
<B>.F</B>

suffix as a Fortran source file that should
<I>not</I>

be run through the C preprocessor.
<A NAME="lbAX">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>WIN32:  Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs. Windows Pythons</H3>

Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities
that let users work on a
Windows system using a more POSIX-like environment.
The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python,
do this, in part,
by sharing an ability to interpret UNIX-like path names.
For example, the Cygwin tools
will internally translate a Cygwin path name
like /cygdrive/c/mydir
to an equivalent Windows pathname
of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\mydir).
<P>
Versions of Python
that are built for native Windows execution,
such as the python.org and ActiveState versions,
do not have the Cygwin path name semantics.
This means that using a native Windows version of Python
to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools
(such as gcc, bison, and flex)
may yield unpredictable results.
&quot;Mixing and matching&quot; in this way
can be made to work,
but it requires careful attention to the use of path names
in your SConscript files.
<P>
In practice, users can sidestep
the issue by adopting the following rules:
When using gcc,
use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter
to run SCons;
when using Microsoft Visual C/C++
(or some other Windows compiler)
use the python.org or ActiveState version of Python
to run SCons.
<A NAME="lbAY">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>WIN32:  scons.bat file</H3>

On WIN32 systems,
SCons is executed via a wrapper
<B>scons.bat</B>

file.
This has (at least) two ramifications:
<P>
First, Windows command-line users
that want to use variable assignment
on the command line
may have to put double quotes
around the assignments:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons &quot;FOO=BAR&quot; &quot;BAZ=BLEH&quot;

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Second, the Cygwin shell does not
recognize this file as being the same
as an
<B>scons</B>

command issued at the command-line prompt.
You can work around this either by
executing
<B>scons.bat</B>

from the Cygwin command line,
or by creating a wrapper shell
script named
<B>scons .</B>

<P>
<A NAME="lbAZ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>MinGW</H3>

<P>
The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or the
PATH variable under the ENV construction variable for SCons
to detect and use the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows
Python interpreter, SCons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin
tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin
directories in the PATH variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC,
then you must explictly tell SCons to use MinGW by passing 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
tools=['mingw']

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
to the Environment() function, because SCons will prefer the MSVC tools
over the MinGW tools.

<H3>Hierarchical Build of Two Libraries Linked With a Program</H3>

SConstruct:

    env = Environment(LIBPATH = ['#libA', '#libB'])
    Export('env')
    SConscript('libA/SConscript')
    SConscript('libB/SConscript')

    e.Program('foo', Split('m1.c m2.c m3.c'))

<P>
The '#' in the LIBPATH directories specify that they're relative to the
top-level directory, so they don't turn into &quot;Main/libA&quot; when they're
used in Main/SConscript.
<P>
Specifying only 'a' and 'b' for the library names
allows SCons to append the appropriate library
prefix and suffix for the current platform
(for example, 'liba.a' on POSIX systems,

<H3>Customizing contruction variables from the command line.</H3>

<P>
The following would allow the C compiler to be specified on the command
line or in the file custom.py. 
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
opts = Options('custom.py')
opts.Add('CC', 'The C compiler.')
env = Environment(options=opts)
Help(opts.GenerateHelpText(env))

<P>
The user could specify the C compiler on the command line:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
scons &quot;CC=my_cc&quot;

</DL>


<P>
or in the custom.py file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
CC = 'my_cc'

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
or get documentation on the options:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$ scons -h

CC: The C compiler.

<H3>Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers</H3>

<P>
Since windows.h includes everything and the kitchen sink, it can take quite
some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so
Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then
include the previously compiled headers in any object file. This
technology is called precompiled headers. The general recipe is to create a
file named &quot;StdAfx.cpp&quot; that includes a single header named &quot;StdAfx.h&quot;, and
then include every header you want to precompile in &quot;StdAfx.h&quot;, and finally
include &quot;StdAfx.h&quot; as the first header in all the source files you are
compiling to object files. For example:
<P>
StdAfx.h:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/windows.h">windows.h</A>&gt;
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/my_big_header.h">my_big_header.h</A>&gt;

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
StdAfx.cpp:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/StdAfx.h">StdAfx.h</A>&gt;

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Foo.cpp:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/StdAfx.h">StdAfx.h</A>&gt;

/* do some stuff */

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
Bar.cpp:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
#include &lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/StdAfx.h">StdAfx.h</A>&gt;

/* do some other stuff */

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
SConstruct:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env=Environment()
env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'
env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])

</PRE>

</DL>


<P>
For more information see the document for the PCH builder, and the PCH and
PCHSTOP construction variables. To learn about the details of precompiled
headers consult the MSDN documention for /Yc, /Yu, and /Yp.

<H3>Using Microsoft Visual C++ external debugging information</H3>

<P>
Since including debugging information in programs and shared libraries can
cause their size to increase significantly, Microsoft provides a mechanism
for including the debugging information in an external file called a PDB
file. SCons supports PDB files through the PDB construction
variable. 
<P>
SConstruct:

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
env=Environment()
env['PDB'] = 'MyApp.pdb'
env.Program('MyApp', ['Foo.cpp', 'Bar.cpp'])

</PRE>

</DL>

For more information see the document for the PDB construction variable.
