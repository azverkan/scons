The C compiler.

<cvar name="CCCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static) object file.
Any options specified in the &cv-CCFLAGS; and &cv-CPPFLAGS; construction variables
are included on this command line.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CCCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when a C source file
is compiled to a (static) object file.
If this is not set, then &cv-CCCOM; (the command line) is displayed.

<example>
env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

<cvar name="CCFLAGS">
<summary>
General options that are passed to the C compiler.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="CPPFLAGS">
<summary>
User-specified C preprocessor options.
These will be included in any command that uses the C preprocessor,
including not just compilation of C and C++ source files
via the &cv-CCCOM;, &cv-SHCCCOM;, &cv-CXXCOM; and &cv-SHCXXCOM; command lines,
but also the &cv-FORTRANPPCOM;, &cv-SHFORTRANPPCOM;,
&cv-F77PPCOM; and &cv-SHF77PPCOM; command lines
used to compile a Fortran source file,
and the &cv-ASPPCOM; command line
used to assemble an assembly language source file,
after first running each file through the C preprocessor.
Note that this variable does
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
contain
<option>-I</option>
(or similar) include search path options
that scons generates automatically from &cv-CPPPATH;.
See &cv-link-_CPPINCFLAGS;, below,
for the variable that expands to those options.

<cvar name="CPPSUFFIXES">
<summary>
The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned

The default list is:

<example>
[".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
 ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
 ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
