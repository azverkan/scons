<cvar name="F77">
<summary>
The Fortran 77 compiler.
You should normally set the &cv-FORTRAN; variable,
which specifies the default Fortran compiler
for all Fortran versions.
You only need to set &cv-F77; if you need to use a specific compiler
or compiler version for Fortran 77 files.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="F77COM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an object file.
You only need to set &cv-F77COM; if you need to use a specific
command line for Fortran 77 files.
You should normally set the &cv-FORTRANCOM; variable,
which specifies the default command line
for all Fortran versions.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="F77COMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file
is compiled to an object file.
If this is not set, then &cv-F77COM; or &cv-FORTRANCOM;
(the command line) is displayed.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="F77FLAGS">
<summary>
General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 77 compiler.
Note that this variable does
<emphasis>not</emphasis>
contain
<option>-I</option>
(or similar) include search path options
that scons generates automatically from &cv-F77PATH;.
See
&cv-_F77INCFLAGS;
below,
for the variable that expands to those options.
You only need to set &cv-F77FLAGS; if you need to define specific
user options for Fortran 77 files.
You should normally set the &cv-FORTRANFLAGS; variable,
which specifies the user-specified options
passed to the default Fortran compiler
for all Fortran versions.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="_F77INCFLAGS">
<summary>
An automatically-generated construction variable
containing the Fortran 77 compiler command-line options
for specifying directories to be searched for include files.
The value of &cv-_F77INCFLAGS; is created
by appending &cv-INCPREFIX; and &cv-INCSUFFIX;
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-F77PATH;.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="F77PATH">
<summary>
The list of directories that the Fortran 77 compiler will search for include
directories. The implicit dependency scanner will search these
directories for include files. Don't explicitly put include directory
arguments in &cv-F77FLAGS; because the result will be non-portable
and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note:
directory names in &cv-F77PATH; will be looked-up relative to the SConscript
directory when they are used in a command. To force
&scons;
to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use #:
You only need to set &cv-F77PATH; if you need to define a specific
include path for Fortran 77 files.
You should normally set the &cv-FORTRANPATH; variable,
which specifies the include path
for the default Fortran compiler
for all Fortran versions.

<example>
env = Environment(F77PATH='#/include')
</example>

The directory look-up can also be forced using the
&Dir;()
function:

<example>
include = Dir('include')
env = Environment(F77PATH=include)
</example>

The directory list will be added to command lines
through the automatically-generated
&cv-_F77INCFLAGS;
construction variable,
which is constructed by
appending the values of the
&cv-INCPREFIX; and &cv-INCSUFFIX;
construction variables
to the beginning and end
of each directory in &cv-F77PATH;.
Any command lines you define that need
the F77PATH directory list should
include &cv-_F77INCFLAGS;:

<example>
env = Environment(F77COM="my_compiler $_F77INCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="F77PPCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file to an object file
after first running the file through the C preprocessor.
Any options specified in the &cv-F77FLAGS; and &cv-CPPFLAGS; construction variables
are included on this command line.
You only need to set &cv-F77PPCOM; if you need to use a specific
C-preprocessor command line for Fortran 77 files.
You should normally set the &cv-FORTRANPPCOM; variable,
which specifies the default C-preprocessor command line
for all Fortran versions.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="SHF77">
<summary>
The Fortran 77 compiler used for generating shared-library objects.
You should normally set the &cv-SHFORTRAN; variable,
which specifies the default Fortran compiler
for all Fortran versions.
You only need to set &cv-SHF77; if you need to use a specific compiler
or compiler version for Fortran 77 files.
</summary>

<cvar name="SHF77COM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a Fortran 77 source file
to a shared-library object file.
You only need to set &cv-SHF77COM; if you need to use a specific
command line for Fortran 77 files.
You should normally set the &cv-SHFORTRANCOM; variable,
which specifies the default command line
for all Fortran versions.

<summary>
The string displayed when a Fortran 77 source file
is compiled to a shared-library object file.
