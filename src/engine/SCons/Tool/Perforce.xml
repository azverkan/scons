<summary>
A factory function that
returns a Builder object
to be used to fetch source files
from the Perforce source code management system.
The returned Builder
is intended to be passed to the
&f-SourceCode;
function.

This function is deprecated.  For details, see the entry for the
&f-SourceCode;
function.

Example:

<example>
env.SourceCode('.', env.Perforce())
</example>

Perforce uses a number of external
environment variables for its operation.
Consequently, this function adds the
following variables from the user's external environment
to the construction environment's
ENV dictionary:
P4CHARSET,
P4CLIENT,
P4LANGUAGE,
P4PASSWD,
P4PORT,
P4USER,
SystemRoot,
USER,
and
USERNAME.
