<builder name="Java">
<summary>
Builds one or more Java class files
from one or more source trees of <filename>.java</filename> files.
The class files will be placed underneath
the specified target directory.
SCons will parse each source <filename>.java</filename> file
to find the classes
(including inner classes)
defined within that file,
and from that figure out the
target <filename>.class</filename> files that will be created.
SCons will also search each Java file
for the Java package name,
which it assumes can be found on a line
beginning with the string
<literal>package</literal>
in the first column;
the resulting <filename>.class</filename> files
will be placed in a directory reflecting
the specified package name.
For example,
the file
<filename>Foo.java</filename>
defining a single public
<classname>Foo</classname>
class and
containing a package name of
<classname>sub.dir</classname>
will generate a corresponding
<filename>sub/dir/Foo.class</filename>
class file.

Example:

<example>
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = 'src')
env.Java(target = 'classes', source = ['src1', 'src2'])
</example>

</builder>

<cvar name="JAVAC">
<summary>
The Java compiler.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVACCOM">
<summary>
The command line used to compile a directory tree containing
Java source files to
corresponding Java class files.
Any options specified in the &cv-link-JAVACFLAGS; construction variable
are included on this command line.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVACCOMSTR">
<summary>
The string displayed when compiling
a directory tree of Java source files to
corresponding Java class files.
If this is not set, then &cv-link-JAVACCOM; (the command line) is displayed.

<example>
env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR = "Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")
</example>
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVACFLAGS">
<summary>
General options that are passed to the Java compiler.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVACLASSDIR">
<summary>
The directory in which Java class files may be found.
This is stripped from the beginning of any Java .class
file names supplied to the
<literal>JavaH</literal>
builder.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVACLASSSUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix for Java class files;
<filename>.class</filename>
by default.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVASUFFIX">
<summary>
The suffix for Java files;
<filename>.java</filename>
by default.
</summary>
</cvar>

<cvar name="JAVAVERSION">
<summary>
Specifies the Java version being used by the &b-Java; builder.
This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> currently used to select one
version of the Java compiler vs. another.
Instead, you should set this to specify the version of Java
supported by your &javac; compiler.
The default is <literal>1.4</literal>.

This is sometimes necessary because
Java 1.5 changed the file names that are created
for nested anonymous inner classes,
which can cause a mismatch with the files
that &SCons; expects will be generated by the &javac; compiler.
Setting &cv-JAVAVERSION; to <literal>1.5</literal>
(or <literal>1.6</literal>, as appropriate)
can make &SCons; realize that a Java 1.5 or 1.6
build is actually up to date.
