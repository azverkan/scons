                 SCons - a software construction tool

                         Version __VERSION__


This is an alpha release of SCons, a tool for building software (and
other files).  SCons is implemented in Python, and its "configuration
files" are actually Python scripts, allowing you to use the full power
of a real scripting language to solve build problems.  You do not,
however, need to know Python to use SCons effectively.

See the RELEASE.txt file for notes about this specific release,
including known problems.  See the CHANGES.txt file for a list of
changes since the previous release.
