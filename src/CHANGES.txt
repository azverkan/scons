                 SCons - a software construction tool

                            Change Log



RELEASE 0.03 - 

  From Charles Crain:

  - Performance improvements in the Node.FS and Sig.Calculator classes.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Search both /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib for scons directories by
    adding them both to sys.path, with whichever is in sys.prefix first.

  - Fix interpreting strings of multiple white-space separated file names
    as separate file names, allowing prefixes and suffixes to be appended
    to each individually.

  - Refactor to move CompositeBuilder initialization logic from the
    factory wrapper to the __init__() method, and allow a Builder to
    have both an action and a src_builder (or array of them).

  - Refactor BuilderBase.__call__() to separate Node creation/lookup
    from initialization of the Node's builder information.

  From Anthony Roach:

  - Add a "duplicate" keyword argument to BuildDir() that can be set
    to prevent linking/copying source files into build directories.

  - Add a "--debug=tree" option to print an ASCII dependency tree.

  - Fetch the location of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler(s) from
    the Registry, instead of hard-coding the location.
    
  - Made Scanner objects take Nodes, not path names.
    
  - Have the C Scanner cache the #include file names instead of
    (re-)scanning the file each time it's called.

  - Created a separate class for parent "nodes" of file system roots,
    eliminating the need for separate is-parent-null checks everywhere.
    
  - Removed defined __hash__() and __cmp() methods from FS.Entry, in
    favor of Python's more efficient built-in identity comparisons.



RELEASE 0.02 - Sun, 23 Dec 2001 19:05:09 -0600

  From Charles Crain:

  - Added the Install(), BuildDir(), and Export() methods.

  - Fix the -C option by delaying setting the top of the FS tree.

  - Avoid putting the directory path on the libraries in the LIBS
    construction variable.

  - Added a GetBuildPath() method to return the full path to the
    Node for a specified string.

  - Fixed variable substitution in CPPPATH and LIBPATH.

  From Steven Knight:

  - Fixed the version comment in the scons.bat (the UNIX geek used
    # instead of @rem).

  - Fix to setup.py so it doesn't require a sys.argv[1] argument.

  - Provide make-like warning message for "command not found" and
    similar errors.

  - Added an EXAMPLES section to the man page.

  - Make Default() targets properly relative to their SConscript
    file's subdirectory.

  From Anthony Roach:

  - Documented CXXFLAGS, CXXCOM, and CPPPATH.

  - Fixed SCONS_LIB_DIR to work as documented.

  - Made Default() accept Nodes as arguments.

  - Changed Export() to make it easier to use.
  
  - Added the Import() and Return() methods.
