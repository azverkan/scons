                 SCons - a software construction tool

                            Release Notes


This is an alpha release of SCons, a tool for building software (and
other files).  SCons is implemented in Python, and its "configuration
files" are actually Python scripts, allowing you to use the full power
of a real scripting language to solve build problems.  You do not,
however, need to know Python to use SCons effectively.

So that everyone using SCons can help each other learn how to use it
more effectively, please sign up for the scons-users mailing list at:

RELEASE 0.12 - Thu, 27 Mar 2003 23:52:09 -0600

  This is the twelfth alpha release of SCons.  Please consult the
  CHANGES.txt file for a list of specific changes since last release.

  Please note the following important changes since release 0.11:

  - The default behavior of SCons is now to change to the directory in
    which an SConscript file resides while reading the SConscript file.
    To disable this and restore the previous behavior of staying in the
    top-level directory, specify the following in your SConstruct file:

        SConscriptChdir(0)

  Please note the following important changes since release 0.10:

    - The default suffix for shared object files when using gcc has
      now been changed to '.os'.  This is to make library builds more
      convenient by allowing both static (compiled without -fPIC) and
      shared object files (compiled with -fPIC) to exist side-by-side.
      If you want to preserve the old behavior of using .o files for
      shared objects, you must now explicitly reset the SHOBJSUFFIX
      value in your construction environment as follows:

        env = Environment(SHOBJSUFFIX = '.o')

  - The default behavior when no targets are specified has been changed
    to be like Make: everything in the current directory and below will
    be built.  This can be disabled by specifying "Default(None)" in an
    SConscript, in which case there will be no default targets and
    SCons will print an appropriate error message.

  - Setting the BUILDERS construction variable now properly clears
    the previous Builder attributes from the construction Environment.
    Before, you could initialize BUILDERS like so:

        env = Environment(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

    And still use the canned default Builders like env.Program(),
    env.Object(), env.StaticLibrary(), etc.  No more.  Beginning with
    SCons 0.10, an initialization like that above will create an
    Environment with only the env.NewBuilder() Builder.

    So now, if you want to use a new builder in addition to the default
    builders, you should explicitly append your new builder to the
    existing ones using techniques like the following:

        env.Append(BUILDERS = {'NewBuilder' : foo})

        env['BUILDERS']['newbuilder'] = foo

  - An "env" argument has been added to the calls to all functions that
    return a string for a Python function Action.  This makes the string
    function and build function calls take the same arguments:

        def build_it(target, source, env):
            # build the target from the source
            return 0

        def string_it(target, source, env):
            return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

        a = Action(build_it, string_it)

    If you have defined a strfunction() for a Python function Action,
    you will need to add a third "env" argument to your function call.

  SCons is developed with an extensive regression test suite, and a
  rigorous development methodology for continually improving that suite.
  Because of this, SCons is of sufficient quality that you can use it
  for real work.  The "alpha" status of the release reflects that we
  still may change interfaces in future releases, which may require
  modifications to your SConscript files.  We strive to hold these
  changes to a minimum.

  Nevertheless, please heed the following disclaimers:

    - There may, of course, be bugs.  Please report any bugs or other
      problems that you find to our bug tracker at our SourceForge
      project page:

      http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=30337&atid=398971

      We have a reliable bug-fixing methodology already in place and
      strive to respond to problems relatively quickly.

    - Documentation is spottier than we'd like.  You may need to dive
      into the source code to figure out how to do something.  Asking
      questions on the scons-users mailing list is also welcome.  We
      will be addressing the documentation in upcoming releases, but
      would be more than glad to have your assistance in correcting this
      problem... :-)

      In particular, the "SCons Design" documentation on the SCons web
      site is currently out of date, as we made significant changes to
      portions of the interface as we figured out what worked and what
      didn't during implementation.

    - There may be performance issues.  Improving SCons performance
      is an ongoing priority.  If you still find the performance
      unacceptable, we would very much like to hear from you and learn
      more about your configuration so we can optimize the right things.

    - Error messages don't always exist where they'd be helpful.
      Please let us know about any errors you ran into that would
      have benefitted from a (more) descriptive message.

  KNOWN PROBLEMS IN THIS RELEASE:

    For a complete list of known problems, consult the SCons bug tracker
    page at SourceForge:

        http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=398971&group_id=30337&func=browse

    - Support for parallel builds (-j) does not work on WIN32 systems
      prior to *official* Python release 2.2 (not 2.2 pre-releases).

      Prior to Python 2.2, there is a bug in Python's Win32
      implementation such that when a thread spawns an external command,
      it blocks all threads from running.  This breaks the SCons
      multithreading architecture used to support -j builds.

      We have included a patch file, os_spawnv_fix.diff, that you can
      use if you you want to fix your version of Python to support
      parallel builds in SCons.

    - Again, the "SCons Design" documentation on the SCons web
      site is currently out of date.  Take what you read there with a
      grain of salt.

    - If a file is specified to be built in multiple ways, the last
      processed builder specification overwrites all other builders,
      without any warning.

    - On Win32 systems, you must put a space between the redirection
      characters < and >, and the specified files (or construction
      variable expansions):

        command < $SOURCE > $TARGET

      If you don't supply a space (for example, "<$SOURCE"), SCons will
      not recognize the redirection.

    - People have reported problems with SCons not stopping a build when
      an interrupt (CTRL+C) is received.  A fix was checked in to 0.11
      that should fix this behavior on many systems, but there are
      issues with the underlying Python os.system() call that suggest
      this fix does not work on all systems or in all circumstances.
      We're working to try to find a universal solution.

    - Executing the -u or -U option from a source directory that has an
      associated BuildDir() does not build the targets in the BuildDir().

    - Modifying a construction environment in a subsidiary SConscript
      file modifies the global environment.

    - PDB files on Win32 in a build that uses BuildDir() are built in
      the source directory, not the build directory.

    - MSVC .res files are not rebuilt when icons change.

    - The -c option does not clean up .sconsign files or directories
      created as part of the build.

    - Switching content signatures from "MD5" to "timestamp" and back
      again can cause unusual errors.  These errors can be cleared up by
      removing all .sconsign files.

    - On Win32, SCons does not recognize that a target specified as
      (for example) \some\target is the same as X:\some\target (for your
      current volume X:).

    - No support yet for the following planned command-line options:

         -d -e -l --list-actions --list-derived --list-where
         -o --override -p -r -R --random -w --write-filenames
         -W --warn-undefined-variables



Thank you for your interest, and please let us know how we can help
improve SCons for your needs.
