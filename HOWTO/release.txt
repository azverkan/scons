Things to do to release a version of SCons:

	Build and test candidate packages

		test on Linux

		test on Windows NT

			1) tar zxf scons-src-{version}.tar.gz
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a

			2) tar zxf scons-{version}.tar.gz
			   cd scons-{version}
			   python setup.py install
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a -x C:\Python15\scons.bat

			3) scons-{verson}.win32.exe
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a -x C:\Python15\scons.bat

	Read through the README.txt file for any updates

	Prepare src/CHANGES.txt

		date -R the latest release

		should be current if this has been updated as each
		change went in.

	Prepare src/RELEASE.txt

		date -R the latest release

		Can probably keep a lot of the existing text, read
		it through to make sure it's okay and edit appropriately.

	Prepare debian/changelog

		date -R the latest release



	END THE BRANCH

		ae_p scons.0

		aede {4}

		aerpass {4}

		aeib {4}

		aeb

		aet

		aet -reg

		aed

		aeipass

	START THE NEW BRANCH

		aenbr -p scons.0 {5}

		aenc -p {scons.0.5}

                        Call it something like, "Initialize the new
                        branch."  Cause = internal_enhancement.  Exempt
                        it from all tests (*_exempt = true).

		ae_p scons.0.5

		aedb 100

		aecd

		# Change the hard-coded package version numbers
		# in the following files.
		aecp Construct debian/changelog rpm/scons.spec

		vi Construct debian/changelog rpm/scons.spec

		# Optionally, do the same in the following:
		[optional] aecp HOWTO/change.txt debian/scons.postinst

		[optional] vi HOWTO/change.txt debian/scons.postinst

		aeb

		aet -reg

		aed

	Announce to the following mailing lists (template below):

		scons-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

		scons-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

			[right away]

		python-announce@python.org

			[right away, it's moderated and will take
			some time to get through]

		linux-announce@news.ornl.gov

			[right away, it's moderated and will take

		python-list@python.org

                        [wait until business hours so the announcemnt

	Notify www.cmtoday.com/contribute.html

                [This guy wants an announcement no more frequently than
                once a month, so save it for a future release if it's
                been too soon since the previous one.]

	Notify freshmeat.net

                [Wait until the morning so the announcement hits the

                awake and working]




=======================

Template release announcement:



I'm pleased to announce that version 0.XXX of SCons has been released
and is available for download from the SCons web site:

        http://www.scons.org/

Or through the download link at the SCons project page at SourceForge:

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/scons/

RPM and Debian packages and a Win32 installer are all available, in
addition to the traditional .tar.gz files.

SCons is a software construction tool (build tool, make tool) written
in Python.  Its design is based on the design which won the Software
Carpentry build tool competition in August 2000 (in turn derived from
the Perl-based Cons build tool).

Distinctive features of SCons include:

  - configuration files are Python scripts, allowing the full use of a
    real scripting language to solve build problems
  - a modular architecture allows the SCons Build Engine to be
    embedded in other Python software
  - a global view of all dependencies; no multiple passes to get
    everything built
  - the ability to scan files for implicit dependencies (#include files);
  - improved parallel build (-j) support
  - use of MD5 signatures to decide if a file has changed
  - easily extensible through user-defined Builder and Scanner objects

An scons-users mailing list has been created for those interested in
getting started using SCons.  You can subscribe at:

        http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scons-users

Alternatively, we invite you to subscribe to the low-volume
scons-announce mailing list to receive notification when new versions of
SCons become available:

        http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scons-announce

Special thanks to XXX for his/her/their contributions to this release.

On behalf of the SCons team,

	--SK
