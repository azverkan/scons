This document covers how to prepare major releases of SCons--that is,
releases numbered with X.Y format, such as 0.93, 1.0, etc.

If you need to prepare a specific subrelease (X.Y.Z, such as 0.94.1),
then see the document HOWTO/subrelease.txt.

Things to do to release a new X.Y version of SCons:

	Prepare the describe-the-release section for the announcements

		summarize changes from src/CHANGES.txt

		template is below, search for "describe-the-release"

		send this out for review while you get the rest of the
		release ready!

	Build and test candidate packages

		test on Linux

		test on Windows NT

			1) tar zxf scons-src-{version}.tar.gz
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a

			2) tar zxf scons-{version}.tar.gz
			   cd scons-{version}
			   python setup.py install
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a -X -x C:\Python20\scons.bat

			3) scons-{verson}.win32.exe
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a -X -x C:\Python20\scons.bat

			4) mkdir temporary_directory
			   cd temporary_directory
			   tar zxf scons-local-{version}.tar.gz
			   cd scons-src-{version}
			   python runtest.py -a -x C:\temporary_directory\scons.py

                Checkin any changes necessary to make everything work

	In the Bugs Tracker, add a Group for the new release 0.{94}



	Test downloading from the SourceForge project page

                You may need to wait a good bit; they seem to update
                this on half-hour cycles.



	Update the web site:

		template:  new version number

		src/index.in:  announcement on the home page

		src/scons-doc.tar.gz:  update

		src/CHANGES.txt:  update

	Test downloading from the web site download page



	Add news item to the SourceForge project page



	Announce to the following mailing lists (template below):

		scons-announce@lists.sourceforge.net
		scons-users@lists.sourceforge.net
		scons-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

			[right away]

		python-announce@python.org

			[right away, it's moderated and will take
			some time to get through]

		linux-announce@news.ornl.gov

			[right away, it's moderated and will take
			some time to get through]

		[optional] cons-discuss@gnu.org

			[only if it's a really big announcement,
			I said we wouldn't bug this list]

		python-list@python.org

                        [wait until business hours so the announcement
			hits mailboxes while U.S. workers are active]

        Notify Gentoo Linux of the update

                For now, we will do this by entering a bug report, and
                attaching the files in build/gentoo to the report.  Go
                to:

                        http://bugs.gentoo.org/

                This requires an account (based on your email address)
                and a certain amount of Bugzilla-based navigation,
                but nothing that's too difficult.

                This is just my best stab at a process that will work
                for Gentoo.  This process may change if the Gentoo
                developers come back and want something submitted in
                some other form.

	Notify www.cmtoday.com/contribute.html

                [This guy wants an announcement no more frequently than
                once a month, so save it for a future release if it's
                been too soon since the previous one.]

	Notify freshmeat.net

                [Wait until the morning so the announcement hits the
                main freshmeat.net page while people in the U.S. are
                awake and working]

ABOUT SCONS

Distinctive features of SCons include:

  - a global view of all dependencies; no multiple passes to get
    everything built properly
  - configuration files are Python scripts, allowing the full use of a
    real scripting language to solve difficult build problems
  - a modular architecture allows the SCons Build Engine to be
    embedded in other Python software
  - the ability to scan files for implicit dependencies (#include files);
  - improved parallel build (-j) support that provides consistent
    build speedup regardless of source tree layout
  - use of MD5 signatures to decide if a file has really changed; no
    need to "touch" files to fool make that something is up-to-date
  - easily extensible through user-defined Builder and Scanner objects
  - build actions can be Python code, as well as external commands

An scons-users mailing list is available for those interested in getting
started using SCons.  You can subscribe at:

	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scons-users

Alternatively, we invite you to subscribe to the low-volume
scons-announce mailing list to receive notification when new versions of
SCons become available:

	http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/scons-announce
