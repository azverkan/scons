#   --rsh=ssh          use ssh for the transfer

#   -t                 preserve times
#   -z                 compress data
#   --stats            file transfer statistics
#   --exclude          exclude files matching the pattern
#   --delete           delete files that don't exist locally
#   --delete-excluded  delete files that match the --exclude patterns
#   --progress         show progress during the transfer
#   -v                 verbose
#
# We no longer use the --stats option.
