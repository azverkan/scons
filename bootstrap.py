"""bootstrap.py

This is an Aegis-to-SCons build script that collects a copy of the
current SCons into a bootstrap/ subdirectory and then executes it with
the supplied command-line options.

Right now, it only understands the SCons -Y option, which is the only
one currently used.  It collects the repositories specified by -Y and
searches them, in order, for the pieces of SCons to copy into the local
bootstrap/ subdirectory.

This is essentially a minimal build of SCons to bootstrap ourselves into
executing it for the full build of all the packages, as specified in our
local SConstruct file.
