<h2 id="steps">Steps for Submitting a Feature Request</h2>

<p>
The following guides you step-by-step through the
process of submitting a feature request.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.tigris.org/servlets/Login">Log in</a> at tigris.org</strong>
<p>
If you do not already have a tigris.org account,
you can register for one at
<a href="http://www.tigris.org/servlets/Join">http://www.tigris.org/servlets/Join</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can still submit a feature request anonymously, without logging in.
If you choose not to create a tigris.org account,
putting some identifying contact information
in the description will be helpful in case
the feature request requires some clarification.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Go to the "Enter issue" page at
<a href="http://scons.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?subcomponent=scons&issue_type=FEATURE">http://scons.tigris.org/issues/enter_bug.cgi?subcomponent=scons&issue_type=FEATURE</a>
</strong>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fill in a good Summary line describing the feature you're requesting</strong>
<p>
This line is what shows up in summary reports,
so it should be descriptive but not too long.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Fill in the Description field</strong>
<p>
This is where you should go into detail
about what you have in mind for SCons.
When in doubt, include more information rather than less.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Press the "Submit issue" to submit your request</strong>
<p>
You will now receive a <strong>Posting issue</strong> page
that gives you the number of the issue you submitted.
If you want to attach a file to your feature request,
you can do so by clicking the
<strong>Attach a file to this issue</strong>
link and using that page to upload a file.

</li>
</ul>
