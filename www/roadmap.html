<p>
The latest release is 1.0.1, released 7 September 2008.

<p>
Our goal is to meet the dates
for release candidates and the releases themselves;
the beta checkpoint dates are our best guess as this was published,
but they may be adjusted on no notice.

<h2>Release Planning</h2>

<h3>Release numbering</h3>

<p>
Our release numbers are of the form <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>revision</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Major release (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.)</strong>
<p>
The major number increments when one of two things happens:
</p>
  <ul>
  <li>The release knowingly breaks backwards compatibility in some way.
  <li>The release knowingly causes a rebuild when you upgrade.
  </ul>
<p>
Our goal is that as a user of SCons,
you should always be able to upgrade to a later
release of the same major version
with complete confidence that your build will not break.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Minor release (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)</strong>
<p>
Minor numbers increment for releases that
add new functionality and/or bug fixes
to an existing major release.
All new functionality will be added so as to never
knowingly break backwards compatibility with any
previous minor releases from the same major release.
We expect that our major releases will be long-lived
platforms for delivering many minor releases to
add functionality and fix bugs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bug-fix revisions (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, etc.)</strong>
<p>
Revision numbers are appended and/or incremented
whenever a critical bug fix is necessary
for a major or minor release.
Bedause most new functionality and bug fixes
will be delivered in minor releases,
we expect that there will be few of these--at most
one per minor release.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Checkpoints (x.y.dyyyymmdd or x.y.z.dyyyymmdd )</strong>
<p>
A checkpoint has a 'd<i>yyymmdd</i>' suffix
and is made every couple of weeks between major or minor releases.
It is intended for beta testing new features
and for ensuring that bug fixes work as intended.
Although existing features will not change,
compatibility of features under test
is not guaranteed between checkpoints
(<i>i.e.</i>, the implementation of the feature may change).
Checkpoints are intended not only to allow for wider testing,
but also to make new features available to users
who urgently need to use the feature in advance
of it being published in the next major or minor release.
Checkpoints can also act as release candidates
immediately prior to a major or minor release.

</ul>
