<h2>Upcoming Releases</h2>

Take these with a huge grain of salt,
this is very rough planning.

  Ability to partition the dependency graph into separate SConstruct
  (not SConscript) files.

<h2>Release Planning</h2>

<h3>Why has 1.0 still not been released?</h3>

<p>
As seems so common these days,
SCons has had an extremely lengthy "beta" period.
The primary goal has been to arrive at something by 1.0
that we feel is absolutely rock-solid-stable
and which people can download and use without fear of
broken builds or unnecessary rebuilds.
To get some idea of how we do this, see our
<a href="testing.html">testing philosophy</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Release numbering</h3>

<p>
Our release numbers are of the form <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>sub</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Major release (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.)</strong>
<p>
The major number increments when one of two things happens:
  <ul>
  <li>The release knowingly breaks backwards compatibility in some way.
  <li>The release knowingly causes a rebuild when you upgrade.
  </ul>
Our goal is that as a user of SCons,
you should always be able to upgrade to a later
revision of the same major number
with complete confidence that your build will not break.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Minor release (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.)</strong>
<p>
Minor releases will add new functionality to an
existing major release branch.
All new functionality will be added so as to never
knowingly break backwards compatibility with any
previous minor releases from the same branch.
We expect that our major release branches will be long-lived
platforms for delivering many minor releases to
add functionality.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bug-fix sub-release (1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, etc.)</strong>
<p>
Released whenever a critical bug fix is necessary
for a major or minor release.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing pre-release (1.1.90, 1.1.91, 1.1.93, etc.)</strong>
<p>
A sub-release number of 90 or greater
indicates the release is intended for
testing a set of new features intended for
wider distribution in the next major or minor release.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our release numbers are of the form <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>sub</i>.
