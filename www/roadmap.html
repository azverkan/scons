<h2>Release Planning</h2>

<h3>Why has 1.0 still not been released?</h3>

<p>
As seems so common these days,
SCons has had an extremely lengthy "beta" period.
The primary goal has been to arrive at something by 1.0
that we feel is absolutely rock-solid-stable
and which people can download and use without fear of
broken builds or unnecessary rebuilds.
To get some idea of how we do this, see our
<a href="testing.html">testing philosophy</a> page.
