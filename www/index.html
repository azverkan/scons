<p>SCons is a next-generation, 
cross-platform, build tool.
Think of SCons as an improved
substitute for the classic
<tt>Make</tt> utility
with integrated functionality
similar to <tt>autoconf</tt>/<tt>automake</tt>
and compiler caches such as <tt>ccache</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Unlike build tools that invent their own mini-language
or wedge a scripting language onto some other
configuration file syntax,
SCons configuration files
are actually Python scripts.
The ability to script your build
gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility
to solve complicated build problems
in surprisingly small amounts of maintainable code.
</p>

<p>
In short, SCons is an easier, more flexible
and more reliable way to build software.

<h3>-----</h3>

<p>Until your project is approved, only you can view it and work on
it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>This index.html will be used if and only if you have the "Use
Project Home Page" option checked on the "Adminster Project" page
(click the "Admin" tab).</li>

<li>To edit this file, check out your project via CVS and edit www/index.html.

<li>You can 'cvs add' and commit other files under the project's "www"
directory and they will published to your project web site.</li>

<li>Also, consider starting a thread in the "dev" mailing list to get
thes discussion started.  A good one is an "introduction" thread where
people post messages about themselves and their interest in the
project.</li>

<li>You can add a "Highlights:" line to the top of all web pages by adding a file www/project_highlights.html </li>
</ul>


<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The goal of The SCons Project
is to become the premiere build tool for
cross-platform, multi-language software projects
by offering unparalleled
reliability,
flexibility
and ease of use.
</p>

<p>What is the scope of this project?
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop just enough functionality to scratch a particular itch</li>
<li>Build a tool just like XYZ, but less broken</li>
<li>Build the best XYZ-tool ever!</li>
</ul>


<p>What are high-level features you are sure to build?
</p>
<ul>

<li>What would you write on a billboard about your project? Users
might only look for a few seconds.</li>

<li>Use the issue tracker to track features and enhancement
requests. It is not just for bugs, pre-populate it with feature
descriptions so that potential contributors know what you would like them
to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> we will use programming language X on operating system Y for now.

<li>We will, or will not, consider certain functional areas like
internationalization, high security, concurrency, etc.  The list of
functional areas will depend on what you are trying to do.

<li>Try to keep this part short.
</ul>


<h3>Related resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link to other stuff that you know about.  It will help you
research requirements and provide a useful resource to potential
contributors.</li>

<li>Why reinvent the wheel? What is better about this wheel?  Is there
any existing project that you can partner with or reuse?</li>

<li>Where would you go to try to find potential contibutors?</li>
</ul>
