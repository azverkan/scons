<p>SCons is a next-generation, 
cross-platform, build tool.
Think of SCons as an improved
substitute for the classic
<tt>Make</tt> utility
with integrated functionality
similar to <tt>autoconf</tt>/<tt>automake</tt>
and compiler caches such as <tt>ccache</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Unlike build tools that invent their own mini-language
or wedge a scripting language onto some other
configuration file syntax,
SCons configuration files
are actually Python scripts.
The ability to script your build
gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility
to solve complicated build problems
in surprisingly small amounts of maintainable code.
</p>

<p>
In short, SCons is an easier, more flexible
and more reliable way to build software.
</p>

<h3>-----</h3>

<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>The goal of The SCons Project
is to become the premiere enterprise-quality tool for
building cross-platform, multi-language software projects
by offering unparalleled <b>reliability</b> and <b>flexibility</b>
to software buildmasters and developers.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, every project has similar lofty mom-and-apple-pie goals,
blah, blah, blah...
So why is SCons any different?
Fair question.
If you go to our public home page at
<a href="http://www.scons.org/">http://www.scons.org</a>
you'll get the usual lists of
supported features and platforms, testimonials, etc.
But you're presumably at <emphasis>this</emphasis>
project page because you're interested in digging a little deeper.
So here are the <emphasis>philosophical viewpoints</emphasis>
that we think contribute to SCons being
a really distinctive software build tool:

<p>What is the scope of this project?
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop just enough functionality to scratch a particular itch</li>
<li>Build a tool just like XYZ, but less broken</li>
<li>Build the best XYZ-tool ever!</li>
</ul>


<p>What are high-level features you are sure to build?
</p>
<ul>

<li>What would you write on a billboard about your project? Users
might only look for a few seconds.</li>

<li>Use the issue tracker to track features and enhancement
requests. It is not just for bugs, pre-populate it with feature
descriptions so that potential contributors know what you would like them
to work on.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the high-level assumptions or ground rules for the project?
</p>

<p>For example:
</p>

<ul>
<li> we will use programming language X on operating system Y for now.

<li>We will, or will not, consider certain functional areas like
internationalization, high security, concurrency, etc.  The list of
functional areas will depend on what you are trying to do.

<li>Try to keep this part short.
</ul>


<h3>Related resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Link to other stuff that you know about.  It will help you
research requirements and provide a useful resource to potential
contributors.</li>

<li>Why reinvent the wheel? What is better about this wheel?  Is there
any existing project that you can partner with or reuse?</li>

<li>Where would you go to try to find potential contibutors?</li>
</ul>
